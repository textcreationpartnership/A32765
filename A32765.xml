            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But whereas the said <hi>Panegyrist</hi> falleth into a gladsome admiration, how from hence there hath risen gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>As good Gods honoured throughout the whole world,</hi> That if ever, as it was lately to our glorious joy evidently, and effectually verified in our late Soveraign, of most dear, sacred, and ever glorious memorie Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the honour of her time, and the mirrour of succeeding ages: so with an assured confidence, we hope it will likewise be proved true in her undoubted and rightfull successour, our dread Lord and Soveraigne.

For the French cannot but acknowledge they have seldome atchieved any honourable acts without Scottish hands, who therefore are deservedly to participate the glory with them.

                  </note> Which <hi>Beda</hi> our Ecclesiasticall Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian recounteth in this manner, and I hope you will give it the reading. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> on a time saw beautifull boyes to be sold in the market at <hi>Rome,</hi> and demanded from whence they were; answer was made him out of the Isle of <hi>Britain.</hi> Then asked he again, whether they were Christians or no? they said no. <hi>Alas for pitie said</hi> Gregory, <hi>that the foul fiend should be Lord of such fair folks; and that they which carry such grace in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, should be void of grace in their hearts.</hi> Then he wold know of them by what name their Nation was called, and they told him. <hi>Angleshmen, And justly be they so called</hi> (quoth he) <hi>for they have Angelike faces, and seem meete to be made coheirs with the Angels in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since which time, they made such happie progress in the Christian profession both of faith and works, that if I should but enter into consideration thereof, I should be over-whelmed with main tides of matter. Many and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable monuments thereof, do every where at home pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves to your view, erected in former times (and no small number in our age, although few men note them) not for affection of fame, or ostentation of wealth, but to the glory of God, increase of faith, of learning and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the poor. As for abroad, the world can testifie that four Englishmen have converted to Christianitie, eight Nations of <hi>Europe. Winfrid alias Boniface,</hi> the Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire-man converted the German <hi>Saxons, Franconians, Hessians,</hi> and <hi>Thuringians: Willebrod</hi> the Northern man, the Frisians and Hollanders. <hi>Nicholas Brakespeare</hi> of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex,</hi> who was afterwards called Pope <hi>Hadrian,</hi> the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians,</hi> and not long since, <hi>Thomas de Walden</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> the <hi>Lithuanians.</hi> Neither will I here note which strangers have observed, that <hi>England</hi> hath bred more Princes renowned for sanctitie, than any Christian Nation whatsoever.

               <p>First, the British tongue or Welsh (as we now call it) was in use onely in this Island,<note place="margin">Britania Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deni.</note> having great affinitie with the old <hi>Gallique</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> now <hi>France,</hi> from whence the first inhabitants in all probability came hither. Afterward the <hi>Latin</hi> was taken up, when it was brought into the form
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54112:15"/> of a Province, by little and little. First, about the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> according to that notable place of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> where he reporteth that <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> Governour here for the <hi>Romans,</hi> preferred the <hi>Britains,</hi> as able to do more by wit, than the <hi>Gauls</hi> by study: <hi>Ut qui</hi> (saith he) <hi>modò lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam Romanam abnuebant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Latine tongue in the Romane Provinces.</note>
                  <hi>eloquentiam concupiscerent. Inde etiam habitus nostri honor &amp; frequens toga.</hi> Then when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Colonies were here planted, and the people ruled by <hi>Roman</hi> laws, written in the Latine tongue: but especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that all born in the Roman Provinces were enfranchised Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, as S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> writeth; or rather by <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> as <hi>Aurel. Victor</hi> reporteth. Then the world accounted themselves all one Nation, and sung, <hi>Jam cunctigens una sumus.</hi> As <hi>Rutilius</hi> to <hi>Romes</hi> praise:
<q>
                     <l>Dumque offers victis proprii consortia juris,</l>
                     <l>Urbem fecisti, quod prius orbis erat.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that so many Latine words remain in the <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> and other tongues, as also from the Popes practise, who imposed the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue in the divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as a token of subjection to the <hi>Romane</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding in this Isle the <hi>British</hi> over-grew the <hi>Latine,</hi> and continueth yet in <hi>Wales,</hi> and some villages of <hi>Cornwall</hi> intermingled with <hi>Provinciall Latine,</hi> being very significative, copious, and pleasantly running upon agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, although harsh in aspirations. After the Irish tongue was brought into the Northwest parts of the Isle, out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the antient Scottishmen, and there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth. Lastly, the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> tongue came in by the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> who valiantly and wisely performed here all the three things, which imply a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, <hi>viz.</hi> the alteration of laws, language; and attire.</p>
               <p>This English tongue is extracted, as the nation, from the Germans, the most glorious of all now extant in <hi>Europe</hi> for their morall, and martiall vertues, and preserving the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty entire, as also for propagating their language by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie victories in <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Francs,</hi> and <hi>Burgundians;</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54112:15"/> in this Isle by the <hi>English-Saxons;</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Heruli,</hi> West-<hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Lombards;</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> by the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> and <hi>Vandales.</hi> And this tongue is of that extension at this present, that it reacheth from <hi>Suiserland,</hi> and from the fountains of <hi>Rhene</hi> over all antient <hi>Germany,</hi> both high and low as far as the river <hi>Vistula</hi> (except <hi>Bohemia, Silesia,</hi> and part of <hi>Polonia</hi> which speak the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> tongue) and also over <hi>Denmarke, Sueden, Gotland, Norway Island</hi> to the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> or <hi>Frozen-Sea;</hi> without any great varietie, as I could prove particularly. But let this suffice, that for the Latine conjunction copulative ET, we and the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> use <hi>And,</hi> the Netherlanders <hi>End,</hi> the Switzers <hi>Vnnd,</hi> other Germans <hi>Ond,</hi> the Gotlanders <hi>Vnt,</hi> the Island<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Ant,</hi> as the old Francs used <hi>Eind</hi> and <hi>Ind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the honour of our progenitors (the <hi>English Saxons</hi>) be it spoken, their conquest was more absolute here over the <hi>Britains,</hi> than either of the <hi>Francs</hi> in <hi>France</hi> over the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> over the <hi>Romans;</hi> or of the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> over the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> For in those nations much of the provinciall Latine (I mean the Latine used whilest they were Provinces of the <hi>Romans</hi>) remaineth, which they po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly had spread over their Empire, as is already said.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> conquerours, altered the tongue which they found here wholly: so that no <hi>British</hi> words, or provinciall <hi>Latin</hi> appeared therein at the first: and in short time they spread it over this whole <hi>Island</hi> from the <hi>Orcades</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> except a few barren corners in the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> parts, whereunto the reliques of the <hi>Britans</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> retired, preserving in them both their life and language. For certain it is that the greatest and best parts, the East and South of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which cal themselves the <hi>Lawland-men,</hi> speak the English tongue varied onely in <hi>Dialect,</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the <hi>English-Saxons:</hi> &amp; the old <hi>Scottish,</hi> which is the very <hi>Irish,</hi> is used onely by them of the West, called the <hi>Hechland-men,</hi> who call the other as the Welsh call us <hi>Sassons, Saxons,</hi> both in respect of language and originall, as I shewed before.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54112:16"/>
               <p>I dare not yet here affirme for the antiquitie of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that our great-great-great grandsires tongue came out of <hi>Persia,</hi> albeit the wonderfull linguist <hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi> hath observed, <hi>Fader, Moder, Bruder, bond, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> tongue in the very sence as we now use them.</p>
               <p>It will not be unproper I hope to this purpose, if I note out of the Epistles of that learned Ambassador <hi>Busbequius,</hi> how the inhabitants of <hi>Taurica Chersonessus,</hi> in the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of <hi>Europe</hi> Eastward, have these words, <hi>Wind, Silver, Corn, Salt, Fish, Son, Apple, Waggen, Singen, Ilanda, Beard,</hi> with many other in the very same sence and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as they now are in use with us, whereat I marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not a little when I first read it. But nothing can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thereby, but that the <hi>Saxons</hi> our progenitors, which planted themselves here in the West, did also to their glory place <hi>Colonies</hi> likewise there in the East.</p>
               <p>As in the Latine tongue, the learned make, in respect of time, four <hi>Idioms,</hi> the <hi>Ancient,</hi> the <hi>Latine,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Mixt:</hi> so we in ours may make the <hi>Ancient English-Saxon,</hi> and the <hi>Mixt.</hi> But that you may see how powerfull <hi>Time</hi> is in altering tongues as all things else, I will set down the Lords Prayer as it was translated in sundrie ages, that you may see by what degrees our tongue is risen, and thereby conjecture how in time it may alter and fall again.</p>
               <p>If we could set it down in the ancient <hi>Saxon,</hi> I mean in the tongue which the English used at their first arrivall here, about 440. years after Christs birth, it would seem most strange and harsh Dutch, or Geberish, as women call it; or when they first embraced Christianitie, about the year of Christ 600. But the ancientest that I can find, was about 900. year since, about the year of Christ 700. found in antient <hi>Saxon</hi> glossed <hi>Evangelists,</hi> in the hands of my good friend M. <hi>Robert Bowyer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Holy Island.</note> written by <hi>Eadfride</hi> the eight Bishop of <hi>Lindiffarne</hi> (which after was translated to <hi>Durham</hi>) and divided according to the antient <hi>Canon of Eusebius,</hi> not into chapters; for <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> Archb. of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> first divided the holy Scriptures into Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

               <p>The holy service of God, which the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> because it knitted the minds of men together, &amp; most people of <hi>Europe</hi> have borrowed the same from them, they called most significantly <hi>Ean-fastnes,</hi> as the one and onely assurance and fast anker-hold of our souls health.</p>
               <p>The gladsome tidings of our salvation, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Euangelion,</hi> and other Nations in the same word,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54112:18"/> they called <hi>Godspel,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which we borrowed from the <hi>French,</hi> and they from the <hi>Latin Salvator,</hi> they called in their own word, <hi>Haelend</hi> from <hi>Hael,</hi> that is <hi>Salus,</hi> safety, which we retain still in <hi>Al-hael,</hi> and <hi>Was-hael,</hi> that is, <hi>Ave, Salve, Sis salvus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They could call the disciples of Christ, <hi>Learning Cnihtas,</hi> that is, <hi>Learning Servitors.</hi> For <hi>Cniht</hi> which is now a name of worship, signified with them an an <hi>Attendant,</hi> or servitour.</p>
               <p>They could name the <hi>Pharisees</hi> according to the <hi>Hebrew Sunder-halgens,</hi> as holy religious men which had sundred and severed themselves from other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> they could call in their proper signification, as <hi>Book-men, Bocer.</hi> So they called parchment which we have catch from the <hi>Latin pergamenum, Boc-fell</hi> in respect of the use.</p>
               <p>So they could call the Sacrament <hi>Haligdome,</hi> as holy judgement. For so it is according as we receive it.</p>
               <p>They could call <hi>fertilitie</hi> and fruitfulness of land signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatively <hi>Eordes-wela,</hi> as wealth of the earth.</p>
               <p>They could call a <hi>Comet,</hi> a <hi>Fixed starre;</hi> which is all one with <hi>Stella crinita,</hi> or <hi>cometa.</hi> So they did call the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat <hi>Domesettle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we call the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>French Parler</hi> to speak, they called a <hi>Wittenmot,</hi> as the Meeting and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of wise men.</p>
               <p>The certain and inward knowledge of that which is in our mind, be it good or bad, which in the Latine word we call <hi>conscience,</hi> they called <hi>Inwit,</hi> as that which they did inwardly wit and wote, that is, know certainly.</p>
               <p>That in a river which the Latines call <hi>Alveus,</hi> and <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and from thence most Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> name the <hi>Chanel, Kanel, Canale, &amp;c.</hi> they properly called the <hi>Stream-race.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither in the degrees of kindred were they destitute of significative words; for he whom we of a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> compound word call <hi>Grandfather,</hi> they called <hi>Eald-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54112:18"/> whom we call <hi>Great Grandfather,</hi> they called <hi>Thirda-fader.</hi> So, him which we call <hi>Great Great Grandfather,</hi> they called <hi>Forda-fader,</hi> and his father <hi>Fiftha-fader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Eunuch,</hi> for whom we have no name, but from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they could aptly name <hi>Vnstana,</hi> that is, without stones, as we use <hi>unspotted</hi> for without spot, <hi>Vnlearned,</hi> for without learning.</p>
               <p>A covetous man whom we so call of the <hi>French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voitise,</hi> they truly called <hi>Git-sor,</hi> as a sore and eagre <hi>Getter,</hi> and <hi>Gatherer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which the Latines call <hi>Abortus,</hi> and we in many words, <hi>Untimely birth,</hi> or <hi>Borne before the full time,</hi> they called <hi>Mis-borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Porter,</hi> which we have received from the <hi>French,</hi> they could in their own word as significatively call <hi>A Doreward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could particulate in many more, but this would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most plentifully, if the labours of the learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Master <hi>Laurence Nowell</hi> of <hi>Lincolnnes Inne,</hi> who first in our time recalled the studie hereof, Master <hi>VVilliam Lambert,</hi> Master <hi>I. Joscelin,</hi> Master <hi>Fr. Tate</hi> were once published. Otherwise it is to be feared, that devowring <hi>Time,</hi> in few years will utterly swallow it, without hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>The alteration and admiration in our tongue, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath been brought in by entrance of Strangers, as <hi>Danes, Normans,</hi> and others which have swarmed hither; by traffick, for new words as well as for new wares, have alwaies come in by the tyrant <hi>Time,</hi> which altereth all under heaven, by <hi>Use,</hi> which swayeth most, and hath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute command in words, and by <hi>pregnant wits:</hi> specially since that learning after long banishment, was recalled in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, it hath been beautified and enriched out of other good tongues, partly by enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising and endenizing strange words, partly by refining and mollifying old words, partly by implanting new words with artificiall composition, happily containing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54112:19"/> themselves within the bounds prescribed by <hi>Horace.</hi> So that our tongue is (and I doubt not but hath been) as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, pithie, and significative, as any other tongue in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> and I hope we are not yet, and shall not hereafter come to that which <hi>Seneca</hi> saw in his time, <hi>When mens minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin once to inure themselves to dislike,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Epist.</note>
                  <hi>whatsoever is usuall is disdained. They affect noveltie in speech, they recall f re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn and uncouth words, they forge new phrases, and that which is newest, is best liked; there is presumptuous and far fetching of words. And some there are that think it a grace if their speech do hover, and thereby hold the hearer in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:</hi> you know what followeth.</p>
               <p>Omitting this, pardon me, and think me not overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced with affection, if I think that our <hi>English</hi> tongue is (I will not say as sacred as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or as learned as the <hi>Greek</hi>) but as fluent as the <hi>Latin,</hi> as courteous as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi> as Courtlike as the <hi>French,</hi> and as amorous as the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> as some Italianated amorous have confessed. Neither hath any thing detracted more from the dignitie of our tongue, than our own affecting of forraign tongues, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, praising, and studying them above measure: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wise <hi>Romans</hi> thought no small part of their honour to consist in the honour of their language, esteeming it a dishonour to answer any forrainer in his own language, As for a long time the English placed in the Borrough-towns of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> would admit neither Irish nor Welsh, among them. And not long since for the honour of our native tongue, <hi>Henry Fitz-Allen,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> in his travell into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Lord <hi>William Howard</hi> of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingham,</hi> in his government of <hi>Calice,</hi> albeit they were not ignorant of other forrain tongues, would answer no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by word or writing, but onely in English. As in this consideration also before them Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> in his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage into <hi>France,</hi> commanded all his servants to use no French, but meer English to the French, in all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whatsoever.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Monosyllables</hi> so rife in our tongue, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54112:19"/> were not so originally, although they are unfitting for verses and measures, yet are they most fit for expressing briefly the first conceits of the mind, or <hi>Intentionalia</hi> as they call them in Schools: so that we can set down more matter in fewer lines, than any other language. Neither do we or the Welsh so curtale the <hi>Latine,</hi> that we make all therein <hi>Monosyllables,</hi> as <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> chargeth us;<note place="margin">In Catalectis.</note> who in the mean time forgetteth, that his Frenchmen have put in their <hi>proviso</hi> in the Edict of <hi>Pacification</hi> in the <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> werre, that they might not pronounce <hi>Latin</hi> distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Irish not to observe quantitie of syllables. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet but confesse that we have corruptly contracted most names both of men and places, if they were of more than two syllables, and thereby hath ensued no little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie.</p>
               <p>Whereas our tongue is mixed, it is no disgrace, when as all the tongues of <hi>Europe</hi> do participate interchangeably the one of the other, and in the learned tongues, there hath been like borrowing one from another. As the present <hi>French</hi> is composed of <hi>Latin, German,</hi> and the old <hi>Gallique,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>German-Gotish,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish</hi> of <hi>Latine, Gotish-German</hi> and <hi>Arabique,</hi> or <hi>Morisquo.</hi> Yet it is false which <hi>Gesner</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">In Mithridate.</note> that our tongue is the most mixt and corrupt of all other. For if it may please any to compare but the Lords Prayer in other languages, he shall find as few <hi>Latine</hi> and borrowed forrain words in ours, as in any other whatsoever. Notwithstanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of Nations, which have swarmed hither, and the practise of the Normans, who as a monument of their Conquest, would have yoaked the English under their tongue, as they did under their command, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to teach their children in Schools nothing but French, by setting down their laws in the Norman-French and enforcing them most rigorously to pleade and to be impleaded in that tongue onely for the space of three hundred years, untill King <hi>Edward</hi> the third enlarged them first from that bondage. Since which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54112:20"/> time, our language hath risen by little, and the proverbe proved untrue, which so long had been used, <hi>Jack would be a gentleman, if he could speak any French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein is a notable argument of our Ancestors stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in esteeming and retaining there own tongue. For as before the Conquest they misliked nothing more in King <hi>Edw.</hi> the Confessor, than that he was Frenchified, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the desire of forraine language then to be a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token of the bringing in of forrain powers, which indeed happened. In like manner after the Conquest, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those enforcements of the Normans in supplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and the nature of men, which is most pliable with a curious jollitie to fashion and frame themselves according to the manners, attire, and language of the Conquerours: Yet in all that long space of 300 years, they intermingled very few French-Norman words, except some termes of law, hunting, hawking, and dicing, when as we within these 60 years, have incorporated so many Latin and French, as the third part of our tongue consisteth now in them. But like themselves continue still those old Englishmen which were planted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Fingall,</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Weysford,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. who yet still continue their antient attire and tongue, in so much that an English gentleman not long since, sent thither in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission among them, said that he would quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Irish, when they spake the antient English. So that our ancestors seemed in part as jealous of their native language, as those <hi>Britains</hi> which passed hence into <hi>Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and marrying strange women there, did cut out their tongues, lest their children should corrupt their language with their mothers tongue, or as the <hi>Germans</hi> which have most of all Nations opposed themselves against all innovations in habite and language.</p>
               <p>Whereas the <hi>Hebrew Rabbines</hi> say, and that truly, that Nature hath given man five instruments for the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all letters, the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the palate, and throat; I will not denie but some among us do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54112:20"/> more fully, some flatly, some broadly, and no few mincingly, offending in defect, excess, or change of letters, which is rather to be imputed to the persons and their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than to the language. When as generally we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce by the confession of strangers, as sweetly, smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moderatly, as any of the Northern Nations of the world, who are noted to soupe their words out of the throat with fat and full spirits.</p>
               <p>This variety of pronunciation hath brought in some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of Orthographie, and hereupon Sir <hi>John Price,</hi> to the derogation of our tongue, and glory of his <hi>Welsh,</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that a sentence spoken by him in <hi>English,</hi> and penned out of his mouth by four good Secretaries, severally, for triall of our Orthography, was so set down by them, that they all differed one from the other in many letters: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as so many <hi>Welsh</hi> writing the same likewise in their tongue, varied not in any one letter at all. Well, I will not derogate from the good Knights credit; yet it hath been seen where ten English writing the same sentence, have all so concurred, that among them all there hath been no other difference, than the adding, or omitting once or twice of our silent <hi>E,</hi> in the end of some words. As for the <hi>Welsh,</hi> I could never happen on two of that Nation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that would acknowledge that they could write their own language.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> her Majesties Secretary not long since a man of great learning and judgement, occasioned by some uncertaintie of our Orthographie, though it seem grounded upon <hi>sound Reason,</hi> and <hi>Custome,</hi> laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to certain heads; Seeing that whereas of Necessity there must be so many letters in every tongue, as there are simple and single sounds, that the Latine letters were not sufficient to express all our simple sounds. Therefore he wished that we should have A short, and A long, because <hi>a</hi> in <hi>Man,</hi> and in <hi>Mân</hi> of horse hath different sounds; E long as in <hi>Mên</hi> moderate, and <hi>e</hi> short as in <hi>Men,</hi> and an English <hi>e</hi> as in <hi>wee, thee, he, me,</hi> I long, and I short as in Bi,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54112:21"/>
                  <hi>per,</hi> and Bi, <hi>emare:</hi> O short, and O long, as in smok of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and smoke of the fire: V long, as in But, <hi>Ocrea,</hi> and V short, as in But <hi>Sed:</hi> and v or y <hi>Greeke,</hi> as slu, nu, tru. For consonants he would have C be never used but for Ch, as it was among the old English, and K in all other words; for Th, he would have the <hi>Saxon</hi> letter <hi>Thorne,</hi> which was a D with a dash through the head, or p; for I consonant the <hi>Saxon</hi> g, as get, not Jeat for Ieat-stone, gay for jay: <hi>Q</hi> if he were king of the A, B, C, should be put to the horn, and banished; and <hi>Ku</hi> in his place, as <hi>Kuik,</hi> not <hi>quik, Kuarel,</hi> not <hi>Quarel:</hi> Z, he would have used for the softer S, or eth, and es, as <hi>dîz</hi> for dieth, <hi>lîz</hi> for lies, and the same <hi>S</hi> inverted for <hi>sh,</hi> as <hi>Sal</hi> for <hi>shall, fles</hi> for <hi>flesh.</hi> Thus briefly I have set you down his devise, which albeit <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to countenance, yet that Tyrant <hi>Custome</hi> hath so confronted, that it will never be admitted.</p>
               <p>If it be any glory which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> do brag of, that many words in their tongues do not differ from the <hi>Greeke,</hi> I can shew you as many in the <hi>English;</hi> wherof I will give you a few for a taste, as they have offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in reading; but withall, I trust you will not gather by consequence, that we are descended from the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of the effectuall power of words, great disputes have been of great wits in all ages; the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> extolled it, the impious Jews ascribed all miracles to a name which was ingraved in the revestiarie of the Temple, watched by

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T were most fitting (in respect of discretion) that men should first weigh matters with judgement, and then encline their affection, where the greatest reason swayeth. But ordinarily it falleth out to the contrary; for either by custom, we first settle our affection, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward draw in those arguments to approve it, which should have foregone, to perswade our selves. This preposterous course, seeing antiquitie from our elders, and universality of our neighbours do entitle with a right, I hold my self the more freely warranted <hi>delirare,</hi> not onely <hi>cum vulgo,</hi> but also <hi>cum sapientibus,</hi> in seeking out with what commendations I may attire our English lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as <hi>Stephanus</hi> had done for the French, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for theirs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Four points. requisite in a language.</note>
                     <hi>Locutio</hi> is defined, <hi>Animi sensus per vocem expressio,</hi> On which ground I build these consequences, that the first and principall point sought in every language, is that we may express the meaning of our minds aptly each to other. Next that we may do it readily without great ado. Then fully, so as others may throughly conceive us. And last of all handsomly, that those to whom we speak may take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in hearing us, so as whatsoever tongue will gain the race of perfection, must run on these four wheels, <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancie,

Now if I can prove that our English language, for all, or the most, is matchable, if not preferrable before any other in use at this day, I hope the assent of any impartiall Reader will pass on my side: And how I endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the same, this short labour shall manifest.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the Significancie,<note place="margin">Significancie.</note> it consisteth in the letters, words, and phrases. And because the Greek and Latine have ever borne away the prerogative from all other tongues; they shall serve as touch stones to make our triall by.</p>

                  <p>In those common to them and us, we have the use of the Greek B in our V, of our B they have none; so have we of their Δ and Θ in our <hi>Th,</hi> which in <hi>that</hi> and <hi>things</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth both; but of our D they have none. Likewise their <hi>Y</hi> we turn to another use in <hi>yeeld,</hi> than they can, and as for EG and I; neither Greeks nor Latines can make profit of them, as we do in these words, <hi>Each, Edge, Joy.</hi> True it is that we in pronouncing the Latine, use them also after this manner; but the same in regard of the antient and right Roman deliverie altogether abusively, as may appear by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith, Lipsius,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Now for the significancie of words,<note place="margin">Words.</note> as every <hi>Individuum</hi> is but one, so in our native English Saxon language, we finde many of them sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again for expressing our passions,<note place="margin">Interjections.</note> our interjections are very apt and forcible.

                  <p>Lastly, our speech doth not consist onely of words,<note place="margin">Metaphors.</note> but in a sort even of deeds, as when we express a matter by Metaphors, wherein the English is very fruitfull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>
                  <p>And so much for the significancie of our language in meaning.</p>
                  <p>Now for his easiness in learning,<note place="margin">Easiness to be learned.</note> the same shooteth out into branches. The one, of others learning our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the second of our learning that of others. For the first, the most part of our words (as I have touched) are Monosyllables, and so the fewer in tale, and the sooner reduced to memorie, neither are we loaden with those declensions, flexions, and variations, which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to many other tongues, but a few articles govern all our verbs and Nouns, and so we reade a very short Grammer.</p>
                  <p>For easie learning of other languages by ours,<note place="margin">To learn others.</note> let these serve as proofs, there are many Italian words, which the French men cannot pronounce; <hi>accio</hi> for which he saith <hi>Ashio:</hi> many of the French, which the Italian can hardly come away withall, as <hi>Bayller chagzni Postillon:</hi> many in ours which neither of them can utter, as <hi>Hedge, Water.</hi> So that a stranger, though never so long conversant amongst us, carrieth evermore a watch-word upon his tongue to descrie him by: but turn an Englishman at any time of his age into what Countrey soever, allowing him due respite, and you shall see him profit so well, that the imitation of his utterance will in nothing differ from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54112:25"/> the pattern of that native language. The want of which towardness cost the <hi>Ephramites</hi> their skins; neither doth this cross my former assertion of others easie learning our language. For I mean of the sence and words, and not touching the pronuntiation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Borrowing.</note>My first proof of our plenty I borrow from the choice which is given us by the use of divers languages. The ground of our own appertaineth to the old Saxon, little differing from the present low <hi>Dutch,</hi> because they more than any of their neighbours have hitherto preserved that speech from any great forreign mixture; here amongst, the Brittans have left divers of their words intersowed, as it were, thereby making a continuall claim to their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent possession. We may also trace the footsteps of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> bitter (though not long during) soveraigntie in these parts, and the <hi>Roman</hi> also imparted unto us of his Latine riches with no sparing hand. Our neighbours the <hi>French,</hi> have been likewise contented we should take up by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile as well their tearms as their fashions: or rather we retain yet but some remnant of that which once here bare all the sway, and daily renew the store. So have our <hi>Italian</hi> travellers brought vs acquainted with their sweet relished phrases, which (so their conditions crept not in withall) were the better tolerable yea, even we seek to make our good of our late Spanish enemie, and fear as little the hurt of his tongue, as the dint of his sword. Seeing then we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (and that not shamefully) from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniard;</hi> how can our stock be other than exceeding plentifull? It may be objected that such patching maketh <hi>Littletons</hi> hotch-pot of our tongue, and in effect brings the same rather to a Babelish confusion, than any one entire language.</p>

                     </label> It may again be answered,that this theft of words is no less warranted by the priviledge of a prescription, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and universall, than was that of goods amongst the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by an enacted law; for so the Greeks rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Hebrews, the Latins the Greeks (which filching <hi>Cicero</hi> with a large discourse in his book <hi>de Oratore</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) and (in a manner) all other Christian Nations the Latine. For evidence hereof, many sentences may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced consisting of words, that in their originall are Latine, and yet (have some small variance in their terminations) fall out all one with the French Dutch, and English, as <hi>Ley,</hi>

Then even as the Italian Potentates of these dayes make no difference in their pedegrees and successions between the bed lawfull or unlawfull, where either an utter wart or a better desert doth force or entice them thereunto so may the consenting practise of these Nations, pass for a just Legitimation of these bastard words, which either necessitie, or convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath induced them to adopt.</p>
                  <p>For our own parts▪<note place="margin">Increase on bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing.</note> we employ the borrowed ware so far to our advantage, that we raise a profit of new words from the same stock, which yet in their own countrey are not merchantable. For example, we deduce divers words from the Latine, which in the Latine it self cannot be yeelded; as the verbs, <hi>To air, to beard▪ to cross, to flame,</hi> and their derivations, ayring, ayred, bearder, bearding, bearded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also closer, closely, closeness, glosingly, hourly, majesticall, majestically.

                        </gap>ss</hi> Divers words also we derive out of the Latine at second hand by the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54112:26"/> French, and make good English, though both Latine and French have their hands closed in that behalf, as in these verbes, <hi>Pray, Point, Paze, Prest, Rent, &amp;c.</hi> and also in the Adverbes <hi>Carpingly Currantly, Actively, Colourably, &amp;c.</hi> Again in other languages there fall out defects, while they want means to deliver that which another tongue expresseth,<note place="margin">Defects of other tongues.</note> as (by <hi>Ciceros</hi> observation) you cannot interpret <hi>Ineptus</hi> unapt, unfit, untoward, in Greek.

                  <p>Moreover the copiousness of our language appeareth in the diversitie of our Dialects, for we have Court and we have Countrey English, we have Northern, and Southern, gross and ordinarie, which differ each from other, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the terminations, but also in many words, termes, and phrases, and express the same thing in divers sorts, yet all write English alike, neither can any tongue (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded) deliver a matter with more varietie than ours, both plainly, and by proverbes and Metaphors: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when we would be ridde of one, we use to say, <hi>Be going, trudge, pack, be faring, hence, away, shift,</hi> and by circumlocution; <hi>Rather your room than your company, lets see your back, come again when I bid you, when you are called, sent for, intreated, willed, desired, invited, spare us your place, another in your stead, a ship of Salt for you, save your credit, you are next the door, the door is open for you, there is no body holdeth you, no body tears your sleeve, &amp;c.</hi> Likewise this word <hi>Fortis</hi> we may synonimize after all these fashions, stout, hardy, valiant, doughty, couragious, adventurous, &amp;c.</p>

                     <note place="margin">All sorts of verses.</note>And in a word, to close up these proofs of our copious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, look into our limitations of all sorts of verses af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by any other language, and you shall finde that

                  <p>I come now to the last and sweetest point of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our tongue, which shall appear the more plainly,<note place="margin">Sweetness.</note> if like two Turkeyies or the <hi>London</hi> Drapers we match it with our neighbours, The Italian is pleasant, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinews, as a still fleeting water.

The Spanish maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, but fulsome, running too much on the O, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like the divell in a play. The Dutch manlike, but withall very harsh, as one ready at every word to pick a quarrell. Now we in borrowing from them, give the strength of consonants to the Italian, the full sound of words to the French, the varietie of terminations to the Spanish, and the mollifying of more vowels, to the Dutch, and so (like Bees) gather the honey of their good properties, and leave the dregs to themselves. And thus when substantialness combineth with delightfulness, fulness with fineness, seemliness with portliness, and currant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with stayedness, how can the language which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of all these, sound other than most full of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</p>

                  <p>These English Saxon, German and other names may be thought as faire, and as fit for men and women, as those most usuall <hi>Praenomina</hi> among the Romans; <hi>Aulus,</hi> for that he was nourished of the gods; <hi>Lucius</hi> for him that was born in the dawning of the day; <hi>Marcus</hi> for him that was borne in March; <hi>Manius</hi> for him that was born in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Cneus</hi> for him that had a wart; <hi>Servius</hi> for him that was borne a slave; <hi>Quinctius</hi> for him that ways fift born, &amp;c.

                  <p>Neither do I think in this comparison of names, that any will prove like the Gentleman, who distasting our names, preferred King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s age before ours, for the gallant, brave, and stately names then used; as sir <hi>Orson;</hi> sir <hi>Tor;</hi> sir <hi>Quadragan;</hi> sir <hi>Dinadan;</hi> sir <hi>Launcelot, &amp;c.</hi> which came out of that forge, out of the which the Spaniards forged the haughty and lofty name <hi>Traquitantos</hi> for his Giant, which he so highly admired, when he had studied many dayes and odde houres, before he could hammer out a name so conformable to such a person, as he in imagination then conceited.</p>

So Surnames passing from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to son, and continuing to their issue, was not ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in use among any people in the world.</p>
               <p>Yet to these single Names were adjoyned oftentimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names, as <hi>Cognomina,</hi> or <hi>Sebriquetts,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call them; and By-names, or Nick-names, as we terme them, if that word be indifferent to good and bad, which still did die with the bearer, and never descended to posterity, That we may not exemplifie in other nations (which would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford great plenty,) but in our own; King <hi>Eadgar</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Peacable; king <hi>Ethelred</hi> the Unready; King <hi>Edmund</hi> for his Valour, <hi>Iron-side;</hi> King <hi>Harold</hi> the Hare-foote; <hi>Eadric</hi> the <hi>Streona,</hi> that is, the Getter or Streiner; <hi>Siward</hi> the <hi>Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> that is, the Valiant; King <hi>William</hi> the first, Bastard; King <hi>William</hi> the second <hi>Rouse,</hi> that is, the Red; King <hi>Henry</hi> the first <hi>Beauclarke,</hi> that is, Fine Scholler: so in the house of <hi>Anjou,</hi> which obtained the Crown of <hi>England; Geffrey</hi> the first Earl of <hi>Anjou</hi> was surnamed <hi>Grisogonel,</hi> that is Grey-cloake; <hi>Fulco</hi> his son <hi>Nerra,</hi> his grand-child <hi>Rechin,</hi> for his extortion. Againe, his grand-child <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> for that he ware commonly a broome-stalke in his bonnet.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54112:59"/> the Royall House of <hi>England,</hi> albeit in late years many have so accounted it. Neither is it lesse strange, why so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should thinke <hi>Theodore</hi> or <hi>Tydur,</hi> as they contract it, to be the surname of the Princes of this Realme since King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh: For albeit <hi>Owen ap Meredith Tydur,</hi> which married <hi>Katherine</hi> the daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt King of <hi>France,</hi> was grandfather to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, yet that <hi>Tydur</hi> or <hi>Theodore</hi> was but the Christian name of <hi>Owens</hi> grandfather. For <hi>Owens</hi> father was <hi>Meredith ap Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur. ap Grono, ap Tydur,</hi> who all without Surnames itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christian names, after the old manner of the <hi>Britaines,</hi> and other nations heretofore noted, and so lineally deduced his pedegree from <hi>Cadwallader</hi> King of the <hi>Britans,</hi> as was found by Commission directed to <hi>Griffin ap Lewellin; Getten Owen, John King,</hi> and other learned men both English and Welch in the seventh year of the said King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh.</p>
               <p>Likewise in the line Royall of <hi>Scotland, Milcolme,</hi> or <hi>Malcome</hi> was surnamed <hi>Canmore,</hi> that is, Great head; and his brother <hi>Donald, Ban,</hi> that is, white: <hi>Alexander</hi> the first, the Proud, <hi>Malcolme</hi> the fourth, the Virgin, <hi>William</hi> his brother the Lion. As amongst the Princes of <hi>Wales, Brochvail Schitrauc,</hi> that is, <hi>Gaggtothed; Gurind, Barmb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truch,</hi> that is, Spade-bearded, <hi>Elidir Coscorvaur,</hi> that is, <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odor</hi> the Great house-keeper; and so in <hi>Ireland, Murogh Duff,</hi> that is, Blacke: <hi>Roo,</hi> that is, Red: <hi>Nemoliah,</hi> that is full of wounds: <hi>Ban,</hi> that is, white: <hi>Ganeloc,</hi> that is, Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>Reogh</hi> Brown; <hi>Moyle,</hi> Bald.</p>
               <p>To seek therefore the ancient Surnames of the Royall, and most ancient families of <hi>Europe,</hi> is to seek that which never was. And therefore greatly are they deceived which thinke <hi>Valoys</hi> to have been the surname of the late French Kings; or <hi>Borbon</hi> of this present King, or <hi>Habsburg,</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striac</hi> of the Spanish King; or <hi>Steward</hi> of the late Kings of of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; now of <hi>Britaine;</hi> or <hi>Oldenburg</hi> of the Danish; For (as all know that have but sipped of Histories) <hi>Valoys</hi> was but the Appenage and Earledome of <hi>Charles</hi> yonger

               <p>Yet in <hi>England</hi> certain it is, that as the better sort, even from the Conquest by little and little took surnames, so they were not setled among the common people fully, untill about the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second: but still varied according to the fathers name, as <hi>Richardson,</hi> if his father were <hi>Richard; Hodgeson,</hi> if his father were <hi>Roger,</hi> or in

               <p>Perhaps this may seem strange to some Englishmen and Scottishmen, who like the Arcadians think their surnames as antient as the Moon, or at the least to reach many an age beyond the conquest. But they which thinke it most strange (I speak under correction,) I doubt they will hardly find any surname, which descended to posterity before that time: Neither have they seene (I fear) any deed or donation before the Conquest, but subsigned with crosses and single names, without surnames in this manner in <hi>England; ✚ Ego Eadre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus confirmavi. ✚ Ego Edmundus corroboravi. ✚ Ego Siga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius conclusi. ✚ Ego Olfstanus consolidavi, &amp;c.</hi> Likewise for <hi>Scotland,</hi> in an old book of <hi>Duresme</hi> in the Charter, whereby <hi>Edgare</hi> son of King <hi>Malcolme</hi> gave lands neer <hi>Coldingham</hi> to that Church, in the year 1097. the Scottish Noblemen witnesses thereunto, had no other surnames than the Christian names of their fathers:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Signum.</hi>

               <p>At a word, all which in English had <hi>Of</hi> set before them, which in Cheshire and the North was contracted into <hi>A,</hi> as <hi>Thomas a Dutton, John a Standish, Adam a Kirby,</hi> and all which in Latin old Evidences have had <hi>De</hi> prefixed, as all heretofore specified, were borrowed from places. As those which had <hi>Le</hi> set before them, were not at all locall, but given in other respects, As <hi>Le Marshall, Le Latimer, Le De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spencer, Le Scroope, Le Savage, Le Vavasour, Le Strange, Le Norice, Le Escrivan, Le Blund, Le Molineux, Le Bret.</hi> As they also which were never noted with <hi>De</hi> or <hi>Le,</hi> in which number I have observed, <hi>Giffard, Basset, Arundel, Howard, Talbot, Bellot, Bigot, Bagot, Taileboise, Talemach, Gervon, Lovell, Lovet, Fortescu, Pancevot, Tirell, Blund</hi> or <hi>Blunt, Bisset, Bacum, &amp;c.</hi> And these distinctions of locall names with <hi>De,</hi> and other with <hi>Le,</hi> or simply, were religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Records untill about the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</p>
               <p>Neither was there, as I said before, or is there any Town, Village, Hamlet, or place in <hi>England,</hi> but hath made names to Families; so that many names are locall which doe not seeme so, because the places are unknown to most men, and all known to no one man: as who would imagin <hi>Whitegift, Powlet, Bacon, Creping, Alshop, Tirwhit, Antrobus, Heather, Hartshorne,</hi> and many such like to be locall names? and yet most certainly they are.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:54112:66"/>
               <p>Many also are so changed by corruption of speech, an dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered so strangely to significative words by the common sort, who desire to make all to be significative, as they seem nothing lesse than locall names; as <hi>Wormwood, Inkepen, Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, Moone, Manners, Drinkewater, Cuckold, Goddolphin, Hurlestone, Waites, Smalbacke, Loscotte, Devill, Neither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Bellowes, Pilpot, Wodill, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Ormund, Ingepen, Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toft, Mohune, Manors, Derwentwater, Coxwold, Godalchan, Hudlestone, Thwaits, Smalbach, Luscot, D'avill,</hi> or <hi>D'Eivill, Nettervill, Bell-house, Philliphot, Wahul, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it to be omitted, that many locall names had <hi>At</hi> prefixed before them in old Evidences, as <hi>At More, At, Slow, At Ho, At Bower, At Wood, At Down, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>At</hi> as it hath been removed from some, so hath it been conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to other, as <hi>Atwood, Atslow, Atho, Atwell, Atmor,</hi> As S also is joyned to most now, as <hi>Manors, Knoles, Crofts, Yates, Gates, Thornes, Groves, Hills, Combes, Holmes, Stokes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rivers also have imposed names to some men, as they have to Townes situated on them; as the old Baron <hi>Sur Teys,</hi> that is, on the river <hi>Teys</hi> running between Yorkshire and the Bishopricke of <hi>Duresme; Derwent-water; Eden, Troutbecke, Hartgill, Esgill, Wampull, Swale, Stoure, Temes, Trent, Tamer, Grant, Tine, Croc, Lone, Lun, Calder, &amp;c.</hi> as some at <hi>Rome</hi> were called <hi>Tiberii, Anieni, Aufidii, &amp;c.</hi> because they were borne neer the rivers <hi>Tibris, Anien, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidus,</hi> as <hi>Julius Paris</hi> noteth.</p>
               <p>Divers also had names from trees neer their habitations, as <hi>Oke, Aspe, Box, Alder, Elder, Beach; Coigners▪</hi> that is, <hi>Quince, Zouch,</hi> that is, the trunk of a tree; <hi>Curly</hi> &amp; <hi>Curson,</hi> the stocke of a <hi>Vine, Pine, Plumme, Chesney</hi> or <hi>Cheyney,</hi> that is, <hi>Oke; Dauney,</hi> that is, <hi>Alder; Foulgiers,</hi> that is, <hi>Fearne; Vine, Ashe, Hawthorne, Furres, Bush, Hasle; Couldray,</hi> that is, <hi>Haslewood; Bucke,</hi> that is, <hi>Beech; Willowes, Thorne, Broome, Blocke, &amp;c.</hi> which in former time had <hi>At</hi> prefixed, as <hi>at Beech, at Furres, at Ashe, at Elme.</hi> And here is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that divers of this sort have been strangely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54112:66"/> as <hi>at Ashe,</hi> into <hi>Tash, at Oke</hi> into <hi>Toke, at Abbey</hi> into <hi>Tabbey;</hi> At the End into Thend; As in Saints names, Saint <hi>Olye</hi> into <hi>Toly,</hi> Saint <hi>Ebbe</hi> into Saint <hi>Tabbe,</hi> Saint <hi>Osyth</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saint <hi>Towses,</hi> and S. <hi>Sithe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many strangers coming hither, and residing here, were named of their Countries, as <hi>Picard, Scot, Lombard, Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, French; Bigod,</hi> that is, superstitious, or Norman, (For so the French men called the Normans, because at every other word they would swear By God:) <hi>Bretton, Britaine, Bret, Burgoin, Germain, Westpholing, Dane, Daneis, Man, Gascoigne, Welsh, Walsh, Walleys, Irish, Cornish, Corn-Wallis, Easterling, Maine, Champneis, Potievin, Angevin, Loring,</hi> that is, <hi>de Lotharingia, &amp;c.</hi> And these had commonly <hi>Le</hi> prefixed in Records and in Writings, as <hi>Le Flemming, Le Picard, Le Bret, &amp;c. viz.</hi> the <hi>Flemming, the Picard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In respect of situation to other near places rise these usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all names, <hi>Norrey, North, South, East, VVest,</hi> and likewise <hi>Northcote, Southcote, Eastcote, Westcote;</hi> which also had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally <hi>At</hi> set before them. Yea, the names of <hi>Kitchin, Hall, Sellar, Parler, Church, Lodge, &amp;c.</hi> may seeme to have been borrowed from the places of birth, or most frequent abode; as among the Greeks, <hi>Anatolius.</hi> i. East: <hi>Zepyhrius.</hi> i. West, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore these locall denominations of families are of no great antiquitie, I cannot yet see why men should think that their Ancestors gave names to places, when the places bare those very names, before any men did their Surnames. Yea, the very terminations of the names are such as are onely proper and appliable to places, and not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in their significations, if any will marke the Locall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which I lately specified. Who would suppose <hi>Hill, Wood, Field, Ford, Ditch, Poole, Pond, Towr,</hi> or <hi>Ton,</hi> and such like terminations, to be convenient for men to beare their names, unlesse they could also dream Hills, Woods, Fields, Fords, Ponds, Pounds, &amp;c. to have been metamorphosed into men by some supernaturall transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54112:67"/>
               <p>And I doubt not but they will confesse, that Townes stand longer than families continue.</p>
               <p>It may also be prooved that many places, which now have Lords denominated of them had Lords and owners of other Surnames, and families not many hundred years since. But a sufficient proofe it is of ancient descent, where the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant had his surname of the place where he inhabiteth, as <hi>Compton</hi> of <hi>Compton; Teringham</hi> of <hi>Teringham; Egerton</hi> of <hi>Egerton; Portington</hi> of <hi>Portington; Skeffington</hi> of <hi>Skeffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; Beeston</hi> of <hi>Beeston, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know neverthelesse, that albeit most Townes have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed their names from their situation, and other respects; yet some with apt terminations have their names from men as <hi>Edwardston, Alfredston, Ʋbsford, Malmesbury,</hi> corruptly, for <hi>Maidulphsbury.</hi> But these names were from fore-names or Christian names, and not from Surnames. For <hi>Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> plainely sheweth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 49.2.</note> that <hi>Wiburton,</hi> and <hi>Leffrington</hi> were so named, because two Knights, <hi>Wiburt,</hi> and <hi>Leofric</hi> there sometimes inhabited. But if any should affirme that the Gentlemen named <hi>Leffrington, Wiburton, Lancaster,</hi> or <hi>Leicester, Bossevill,</hi> or <hi>Shordich,</hi> gave the names to the places so named, I would humbly, without prejudice, crave respite for a further day before I beleeved them. And to say as I thinke, verily when they shall better advise themselves, and marke well the terminations of these, and such like Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call names, they will not presse me over eagerly herein.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, certain it is that Surnames of families have been adjoyned to the names of places for distinction, or to notifie the owner, as <hi>Melton Mowbray: Higham Ferrers; Minster-Lovell; Stansted Rivers; Drayton Basser, Kibworth Beauchamp &amp;c.</hi> For that they were the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Mowbray, Ferrers, Lovell, &amp;c</hi> Neither do I deny but some among us in former time, as well as now, dreaming of the immortality of their names, have named their Houses after their own names, as <hi>Camois-Court, Hamons, Bretes, Bailies, Theobaldes,</hi> when as now they have possessors of others names. And the old verse is, and alwayes will be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54112:67"/> verified of them, which a right worshipfull friend of mine not long since writ upon his new house.</p>
               <q>Nunc mea, mox hujus, sed postea nescit cujus.</q>
               <p>Neither must all, having their names from places, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that their Ancestors were either Lords, or possessors of them; but may assure themselves, that they original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came from them, or were borne at them. But the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Polonians do clear this errour by placing <hi>In</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Locall names, if they are possessours of the place, or <hi>Of,</hi> if they onely were born at them, as <hi>Martinus Gromerus</hi> noteth. The like also seemeth to be in use in the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for there you shall have <hi>Trotter</hi> of <hi>Folshaw,</hi> and <hi>Trotter</hi> in <hi>Fogo; Hartly</hi> of <hi>Haitly,</hi> and <hi>Hait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in <hi>Haitly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas since the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third the Princes children took names from their natall places, as <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Carnarvon, Thomas</hi> of <hi>Brotherton, Joane</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, Edmund</hi> of <hi>Woodstocke;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> (who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his children by <hi>Cath. Swinford, Beaufort</hi> of a place in France belonging to the House of Lancaster,) it is nothing to our purpose, to make further mention of them, when as they never descended to their posteritie.</p>
               <p>After these locall names, the most names in number have been derived from Occupations, or Professions, as Taylor, Potter, Smith, Sadler, Arblaster, that is <hi>Balistarius,</hi> Archer, Taverner, Chauser. i.

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54112:68"/> or <hi>eo</hi> or <hi>io</hi> for their terminations, as <hi>Linteo, Pellio, Phrygio.</hi>

               <p>Neither was there any trade, craft, art, profession, occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never so meane, but had a name among us common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ending in <hi>Er,</hi> and men accordingly denominated; but some are worne out of use, and therefore the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are unknown, and other have been mollified ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously by the bearers, lest they should seem vilified by them. And yet the like names were among the noblest Romans, as <hi>Figulus, Pictor, Fabritius, Scribonius, Salinator, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus, Agricola, Carbo, Funarius, &amp;c.</hi> And who can deny but they so named may be Gentlemen, if Virtue, which is the soul of Gentrie, shall ennoble them, and <hi>Virtus</hi> (as one saith) <hi>Nulli praeclusa est, omnibus patet.</hi> Albeit Doctor <hi>Turner</hi> in a Book against <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> saith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, exemplifying of their own names. At which time, wise was the man that told my Lord Bishop, that his name was not <hi>Gardiner,</hi> as the English pronounce it, but <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> with the French accent, and therefore a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Hitherto may be referred many that end in <hi>Man,</hi> as Tubman, Carreman, Coachman, Ferriman, Clothman, Chapman, Spelman, <hi>id est,</hi> Learned man, Palfriman, Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Upon such like occasions names were given among the Romans, as <hi>Tremellius</hi> was called <hi>Scropha</hi> or Sow,<note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> because when he had hid his neighbours Sow under a padde, and commanded his wife to lie down thereon; he sware when the owner came in to seek the Sow, that he had no Sow but the great Sow that lay there, pointing to the padde, and the Sow his wife. So one <hi>Cornelius</hi> was surnamed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina,</hi> for that when he was to put in assurance for payment of certain sums in a purchase, he brought his Ase laden with money, and made ready payment.<note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> So <hi>Augustus</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his dwarfe <hi>Sarmentum,</hi> i.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54112:73"/> linking together false surmises, to their utter undoing in the time of <hi>Constantinus</hi> the younger, who also (that I may remember it in passage) named his attendant scholler by no unfitting name, <hi>Musonius.</hi> But what names the beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly monster rather than Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> gave to his attendants, I dare not mention, least I should be immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly offensive to chaste ears, and modest minds; yet hitherto with modesty may be referred this of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Gephyri,</hi> i. <hi>Bridges</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> who took their name from a Bridge; for when their mother was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of nine children at a birth, and in a foolish fear had privily sent seven of them to be drowned at a bridge, the Father suddenly coming to the bridge, saved them, and thereupon gave them that name. Of these, and the like, we may say, <hi>Propiora sunt honori, quam ignominiae.</hi> Infinite are the occasions which in like manner have made names to persons, I will onely report one or two French exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that thereby you may imagine of others in other places, and former ages.</p>
               <p>In the first broyls of <hi>France,</hi> certain companies ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themselves into ttoops, one Captain took new names to himself and his company from the furniture of an horse. Among these new named gallants; you might have heard of <hi>Monsieur Saddle,</hi> (to English them) <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Bridle, Le Croupier, Le Girte, Horshoe, Bitte, Trappiers, Hoof, Stirrop, Curbe, Musrole, Fronstal, &amp;c.</hi> Most of the which had their pasport, as my Author noteth, by <hi>Seigneur de la Halter.</hi> Another Captain there also gave names to his according to the places where he found them as <hi>Hedg, Highway, River, Pond, Vine, Stable, Street, Corner, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; Taverne, Tree, &amp;c.</hi> And I have heard of a consort in <hi>England,</hi> who when they had served at Sea, took names from the equipage of a ship, when they would serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at land, as <hi>Keel, Ballast, Planke, Fore-decke, Decke, Loope-hole, Pump, Rudder, Gable, Anchor, Misen sail, Capson, Maste, Belt.</hi> So that is true which <hi>Isidore</hi> saith, <hi>Names are not alwaies given according to Nature, but some
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54112:73"/> after our own will and pleasure, as we name our Lands and servants according to our own liking.</hi> And the Dutchmans saying may be verified, which when he heard of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men called God and Divell, said, that English borrowed names from all things whatsoever, good or bad.</p>
               <p>It might be here questioned, whether these surnames were assumed and taken at the first by the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or imposed and given unto them by others. It may aswell seeme that the locall names of persons were partly taken up by themselves, if they were owners of the place, as given by the people, who have the soveraignty of words and names, as they did in the Nick-names before Surnames were in use. For who would have named himself <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Ʋnready, Without-land, Beaucleark; Strongbow, Gagtooth, Blanch-main, Bossue,</hi> i. Crook-back, but the concurrent voyce of the people? as the woman neighbours gave the name to <hi>Obed</hi> in the book of <hi>Ruth;</hi> and likewise in Surnames. In these pretty names, as I may terme them, from floures, fishes, birds, habitudes, &amp;c. it may be thought that they came from Nurses in former times here, as very many, or rather most in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> do at this present. These Nick-names of one syllable turned to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, as <hi>Dicks, Nicks, Toms, Hobbs, &amp;c.</hi> may also seem to proceed from Nurses to their Nurslings; or from fathers and masters to their boys and servants. For, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old proverbe, <hi>Omnis herus servo Monosylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> in respect of their short commands: so, <hi>Omnis servus hero Monosyllabus,</hi> in respect of the curtailing their names, as <hi>Wil, Sim, Hodge, &amp;c.</hi> Neither is it improbable, but that many names, that seeme unfitting for men, as of brutish beasts, &amp;c. came from the very signes of the houses where they inhabited; for I have heard of them which said they spake of knowledge, that some in late time dwelling at the signe of the Dolphin, Bull, White-horse, Racket, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, &amp;c. were commonly called <hi>Thomas</hi> at the <hi>Dolphin, Will</hi> at the <hi>Bull, George</hi> at the <hi>White-horse, Robin</hi> at the <hi>Racket,</hi> which names as many others of like sort,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54112:74"/> with omitting <hi>At,</hi> became afterward hereditarie to their children.</p>
               <p>Hereby some insight may be had in the originall of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, yet it is a matter of great difficultie, to bring them all to certain heads, when as our language is so greatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, so many new names daily brought in by aliens, as French, Scots, Irish, Welsh, Dutch, &amp;c. and so many old words worne out of use. I meane not onely in the old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, but also the late Norman: for who knoweth now what these names were, <hi>Giffard, Basset, Gernon, Mallet, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Peverell, Paganel,</hi> or <hi>Paynel; Tailboise, Talbot, Lovet, Pancevolt, Tirrell, &amp;c.</hi> which are nothing lesse than locall, and certainly significative, for they are never noted, as I said before, in old evidences with <hi>De,</hi> as locall names, but alwayes absolutely, as <hi>W. Giffard, R. Basset,</hi> as Christian names are, when they are made Surnames; and yet I will not affirme, that all these here mentioned were at any time Christian names, although doubtlesse some were.</p>
               <p>For we know the significations of some of them, as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> an Hammer, <hi>Bigot,</hi> a Norman, or superstitious; <hi>Taile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi>

               <p>Neither is it to be forgotten, that men were not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to change name or surname, by the rescript of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian L.

               <p>It was usuall amongst the Christians in the Primitive Church, to change at Baptisme the names of <hi>Catecumeni,</hi> which were in years, as that impious <hi>Renegado,</hi> that was before called <hi>Lucius,</hi> was in his Baptisme called <hi>Lucianus.</hi> So the Popes use to change their names, when they enter into the Papacie, which as <hi>Platina</hi> saith, was begun by Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the second, who first changed his name, for that his former name was <hi>Hogges-mouth;</hi> but other referre the change of names in Popes to Christ, who changed <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> into <hi>Peter, John</hi> and <hi>James</hi> into <hi>Boanerges:</hi> only <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> not long since chosen Pope, refused to change his name, saying, <hi>Marcellus</hi> I was, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> I will be, I will neither change Name nor Manners. Other religious men also, when they entred into some Orders, changed their names in times past, following therein (as they report) the Apostle, that changed his name from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> after he entred into the Ministery, borrowing (as some say) that name from <hi>Sargius Paulus</hi> the Roman lieutenant, but as other will, from his low stature, for he was but three cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high,<note place="margin">Chrysostomus.</note> as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaking of him, <hi>Tricubitatis ille, tamen coelum ascendit.</hi>

               <p>Hereupon some thinke that without the Kings licence new names cannot be taken, or old names given away to others. Yet <hi>Tiraquell</hi> the great <hi>Civilian</hi> of <hi>France, in Leg. quin. Conub. Tit.</hi> 92. seemeth to incline, that both name &amp; Armes may be transferred by Will and Testament, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>Augustus,</hi> who by his Testament commanded <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> and <hi>Livia</hi> to beare his name. How in former times <hi>Heronville, Dumvile,</hi> and <hi>Clanwowe,</hi> gave and granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Armes, which are as silent names, distinctions of families; and the same was thought unlawfull afterward, when the Lord <hi>Hoo</hi> would have done the same, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54112:77"/> in more convenient place. But the inconvenience of change of names, hath been discovered to be such in <hi>France,</hi> that it hath been propounded in the Parliament at <hi>Dijon,</hi> that it should not be permitted but in these two respects; either when one should be made heire to any with any es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall words, to assume the name of the testator; or when any one should have donation surmounting a thousand crownes, upon the same condition. But to retire to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>Not a few have assumed the names of their fathers Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as in former times the issue of <hi>Richard Fitz-Gilbert,</hi> tooke the name of <hi>Clare,</hi> which was their Barony: and in late time, since the <hi>Suttons</hi> came to the Barony of <hi>Dudley,</hi> all their issue took the name of <hi>Dudleyes.</hi> The dislike of others hath caused also a change of names, for King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first, disliking the iteration of <hi>Fitz,</hi> commanded the Lord <hi>John Fitz-Robert,</hi> an ancient Baron,<note place="margin">Lib. Monast. Sibeton.</note> (whose An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours had continued their Surnames by their fathers Christian names,) to leave that manner, and be called <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Clavering,</hi> which was the capitall seat of his Barony. And in this time, many that had followed that course of naming by <hi>Fitz,</hi> took them one setled name, and retained it, as <hi>Fitz Walter,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Also at that time the names of <hi>Thomson, Richardson, Wilson,</hi> and other of that forme began to be setled, which before had varied according to the name of the father: <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth likewise (as I have heard,) loving some whose name was <hi>Picard,</hi> would often tell them that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them well, but not their names, whereupon some of them changed their names: and I have heard that one of them took the name of <hi>Ruddle,</hi> being the place of his birth in that respect. And in late years in the time of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eight, an ancient worshipfull gentleman of <hi>Wales,</hi> being called at the pannell of a Jury by the name of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ap William, Ap Thomas, Ap Richard, Ap Hoel, Ap Evan Vaghan, &amp;c.</hi> was advised by the Judge to leave that old manner. Whereupon he after called himself <hi>Moston,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:54112:78"/> according to the name of his principall house, and left that Surname to his posterity.</p>
               <p>Offices have brought new names to divers families, as when <hi>Edward Fitz-Theobald</hi> was made Butler of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Ormond</hi> and others descended from them, took the name of <hi>Butler.</hi> So the distinct families of the <hi>Constables</hi> in the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> are said to have taken that name, from some of their Auncestors, which bare the office of Constables of some Castles. In like manner the <hi>Stewards, Marshals, Spencers.</hi> That I may say nothing of such as for well acting on the stage, have carried away the names of the personages which they acted, and have lost their own names among the people.</p>
               <p>Schollers pride hath wrought alterations in some names, which have been sweetned in sound, by drawing them to the Latin <hi>Analogie.</hi> As that notable Non-resident in our fathers time Doctor <hi>Magnus,</hi> who being a soundling at <hi>Newarke</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> where he erected a Grammar-Schoole, was called by the people <hi>T. Among us;</hi> for that he was found among them: But he profiting in learning, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Among us,</hi> into <hi>Magnus,</hi> &amp; was famous by that name, not only here, but also in forraine places where he was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour.</p>
               <p>It were needlesse to note here againe, how many have taken in former times the Christian name of their father, with prefixing of <hi>Fitz,</hi> or <hi>Filz,</hi> as <hi>Fitz-Hugh, Fitz-Alan, Fitz-William,</hi> or adding of <hi>Son,</hi> as <hi>Richardson, Tomson, Johnson, &amp;c.</hi> and so altered their Surnames, if they had any. Whereas divers ancient Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> do beare Coates of Armes, which by old roules and good proofes are known to belong to other names and families, and cannot make proofe that they matched with those families, it is worth observation, (considering how strict they were in el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times in keeping their own Armes) whether they were not of those ancient houses whose Armes they beare, and have changed their names in respect of their habitation, or partitions and lands gotten by their wives? As <hi>Pickering</hi> of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54112:78"/> the North, beareth Ermin a Lion rampant Azure crowned. Or which, as it is in the old Abby-book of <hi>Furnesse,</hi> was the coat of <hi>Roger de Miythorp.</hi> In the same book the coate of <hi>Dacre, Gules, three Escalopes Argent,</hi> is the coate of <hi>R. Gerneth</hi> of <hi>Cumberland:</hi> And so the three pillowes Ermin of <hi>Redman</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> is the coate of <hi>Ran. de Greystocke.</hi> So <hi>Ʋfford</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Peiton, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplace,</hi> and <hi>Hide,</hi> and many other Gentlemen of the same Armes, may seeme to have been of the same stock, and to have varied their names in divers respects.</p>
               <p>Finally, among the common people which sway all in names, many Surnames have been changed in respect of occupations, and not a few have been changed in respect of masters, for in every place we see the youth very commonly called by the names of their occupations, as <hi>John</hi> Baker, <hi>Thomas</hi> Tayler, <hi>Will</hi> Buther, <hi>Dic</hi> Barber; and many by their masters names, as <hi>John Pickering, Thomas Watkins, Nicholas French,</hi> when as they served masters of those names, which often were conveyed to their posterity, and their own Surnames altogether forgotten. Some other causes of alteration of names may be found, as for crimes committed when men have been enforced to leave their Countries. But hereby it may be understood that an <hi>Alias</hi> or double name cannot prejudice the honest: and it is known that when Judge <hi>Catiline</hi> tooke exception at one in this respect, saying that no honest man had a double name, and came in with an <hi>Alias.</hi> The party asked him what exception his Lordship could take to Jesus Christ, <hi>Alias</hi> Jesus of <hi>Nazareth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but some men among us in changing their names, do imitate old Gaffer <hi>Simon</hi> the Cobbler in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who when he grew fat in the purse, would needs be called for Goodman <hi>Simon,</hi> Master <hi>Simonides,</hi> as some women do follow the good Greek wench <hi>Melissarion,</hi> that is, Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty honney-Be, who when of a Comedians, she became a wealthy mans wife, would be saluted Madam <hi>Pithias,</hi> or <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aristinetus.</note> And some likewise can change themselves from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54112:79"/> she, to he, and so consequently their name, as <hi>Cenx</hi> the wench, into <hi>Ceneus</hi> the young man, at you may see in <hi>Ovid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the alteration of names, it may also be remembred how Kings of Armes, Heraulds, and Pursevants are new named with a bowl of wine powred on their heads by the Prince, or Earle Marshall, when they are invested, and the Kings crowned, as <hi>Garter, Clarencoux, Norrey, Lancaster, Yorke, Richmond, Somerset, &amp;c.</hi> which is as ancient as the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third. For we read that when newes was brought him at <hi>Windsor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proffard.</note> by a Pursuivant, of the victory at the battell of <hi>Auroy,</hi> he bountifully rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and immediatly created him Herauld, by the name of <hi>Windsor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here might I note that women with us at their marriage do change their surnames, and passe into their husbands names, and justly, for that then <hi>Non sunt duo, sed caro una:</hi> And yet in <hi>France</hi> and the Netherlands, the better sort of women will still retain their own name with their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as if <hi>Marie</hi> daughter of <hi>Villevill</hi> be married to <hi>A. Vavill,</hi> she will write her self <hi>Mary Vavill Villevill.</hi> But I fear husbands will not like this note, for that some of their dames may be ambitiously over-pert and too too forward to imitate it.</p>
               <p>Beside these former alterations, the tyrant Time which hath swallowed many names, hath also in use of speech, changed more by contracting, syncopating, curtolling, and mollifying them, as beside them before mentioned, <hi>Adrecy,</hi> is now turned into <hi>D'arcy, Aldetholighe</hi> into <hi>Awdley, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigworth</hi> into <hi>Sapsford, Sitfil</hi> into <hi>Cecill, Mount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for additions given over and beside names, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names in Law causes, that I may note them out of a Law-Book, they are either of estate, or degree, or mysterie, or town, or hamlet, or countie. Addition of estate are these; Yeoman, Gentleman, Esquire. Addition of degree are those which we call names of dignitie, as Knight, Earl, Marquess, Duke. Additions of mysterie are such, Scrivener, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Smith. Addition of towns as of <hi>Padington, Islington, Edelmeton.</hi> And where a man hath houshold in two places, he shall be said to dwell in both of them, so that his addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in one of them doth suffice.<note place="margin">Additions how long frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By the Statute the first yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift and fift Chapter, it was ordained, that in suites or in actions, where processe of Utlary lyeth, such addition should be to the name of the Defendant, to shew his estate, mystery, and place where he dwelleth, and that such Writs shall abate, if they have not such additions, if the Defendant do take exception thereat, they shall not abate by the office of the Court.</p>
               <p>Also, Duke, Marquesse, Earl, or Knight be none of that addition, but names of dignitie, which should have been given before the statute. And this was ordained by the said statute, made in the first yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. Chap. 5. to the intent that one man may not be grieved or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Utlary of another, but that by reason of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain addition every man might be certainly known, and beare his own burden.</p>
               <p>How the names of them, which for capitall crimes against <hi>Majestie,</hi> were crazed out of the publick Records, Tables,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54112:82"/> and Registers, or forbidden to be borne by their posterity, when their memory was damned, I could shew at large; but this and such like, with <hi>Masnomer</hi> in our Laws, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quidities, I leave to the professors of Laws.</p>
               <p>Somewhat might be said here of the adjuncts to names or titles, which in ancient times were either none,<note place="margin">Adjuncts to names.</note> or most simple. For <hi>Augustus</hi> was impatient to be called <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus;</hi> yet <hi>Domitian</hi> liked well to be called <hi>Dominus Deus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que:</hi> and <hi>Dominus</hi> was taken up by every private man, as appeareth by <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the poor Grecian which refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that title by alluding <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse it was never used by the Emperours, from <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> to <hi>Dioclesianus,</hi> as <hi>Victor</hi> noteth; but afterward it was continued by the Christian Emperours, yea, upon their Coines.</p>
               <p>And that which is more strange, they used then as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Constitutions, for themselves. <hi>Aeternitas nostra, Perennit as nostra, Numen nostrum;</hi> and to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall officers, <hi>Vir illustris, Vir spectabilis, Magnifica cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdo, Sublimis magnitudo tua, Illustris magnificentia, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimitas, Miranda sublimitas, Eminentia tua, Excellentia tua, Praecelsa magnificentia tua, &amp;c.</hi> As appeareth in the Volumes of the Civill Law.

               <p>The Romans under the later Emperours had a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and carefull observation,<note place="margin">Titles artribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to men of note by the Romans. <hi>Cod. Theod. &amp; Justinian.</hi>
                  </note> in giving titles to men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which as I have read were onely five; <hi>Illustris</hi> was the highest appropriated to the <hi>Praefecti Praetorio</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gallia;</hi> the <hi>Praefectus</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Rome, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister Equitum, Magister Peditum, Quaestor Palatii, Comes Largitionis, &amp;c.</hi> and all that had voice in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>Spectabilis</hi> was the second title due to the Lieutenants Generall, and <hi>Comites</hi> of Provinces, &amp;c. So <hi>in notitia Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciarum, Vicarius Britanniarum, Comes Littoris Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54112:83"/> per Britanniam, Dux Britannia,</hi> are stiled <hi>Viri specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles. Clarissimus</hi> was the third title peculiar onely to the <hi>Consulares, Correctores,</hi> and <hi>Prostaes</hi> of Provinces <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctissimus</hi> was the fourth. <hi>Egregius</hi> the fift.

               <p>The precise in this practise strictly observing all the parts of the definition, are onely bold with <hi>H.</hi> either in omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or retaining it, for that it cannot challenge the right of a letter.

               <p>The French exceedingly admire and celebrate this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie for the deepe and farre fetched antiquity, the piked fines and the mysticall significations thereby: for that Names are divine notes, and divine notes do notifie future events; so that events consequently must lurke in Names, which onely can be pryed into by this mysterie. Affirming that each mans fortune is written in his Name; as Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians say, all things are written in Heaven, if a man could read them: they exemplifie out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> they quote
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54112:89"/> dreaming <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> with other allegations; they urge particular experiments, and so enforce the matter with strong words and weak proofs, that some credulous young men, hovering between hope and fear, might easily be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by them into the forbidden superstition of <hi>Ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia,</hi> or South-saying by names.</p>

And such will not deny, but that as good names may be ominons, so also good <hi>Anagrams,</hi> with a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full comfort and pleasant motion in honest minds, in no point yeelding to any vain pleasures of the body.

               <p>If profound antiquity, or the inventor may commend an invention, this will not give place to many.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a received opinion, that in most ancient ages, there was onely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie or change of wares, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities amongst most nations. As in <hi>Homer, Glaucus</hi> golden armour was valued at one hundred cowes, and <hi>Diomedes</hi> at ten. Afterward in commutative Justice it was thought most necessarie to have a common measure, and valuation, as it were of the equality and inequality of wares, which was invented, first, as the Jewes gather out of <hi>Josephus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Cain.</hi> Certainly, it was in use in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as appeareth both by the 400. Sheckles he payed for a place of burial. <hi>Genes.</hi> 23. and the money which <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren carried into Aegypt. <hi>Genes.</hi> 42.</p>
               <p>The Greeks refer the invention of it to <hi>Hermodice,</hi> the wise wife of the foolish asse-eared <hi>Midas,</hi> as the Latines to <hi>Janus.</hi> This common measure or meane to reduce wares to an equality, was called by the Greeks, <hi>Nomisma,</hi> not from King <hi>Numa,</hi> But of <hi>Nomos:</hi> Because it was ordained by law; by the Latines <hi>Pecunia,</hi> either for that all their wealth in elder times consisted in cattell: as now among the Irish; or that their first coyne (as <hi>Plinie</hi> will) was stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with a Cow (although in a generall signification <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> comprised all goods moveable and immoveable.) It was also by them called <hi>Moneta</hi> in a more restrict signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation a <hi>Monendo,</hi> (as <hi>Suidas</hi> saith) because when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54112:95"/> stood in need of money, <hi>Juno</hi> admonished them to use justice, and there should be no want of money: the effect thereof when they found, she was surnamed <hi>Juno Moneta,</hi> and money was coyned in her Temple. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit money had no temple erected to it at Rome for a long time, yet it was as much honoured as either <hi>Peace, Faith, Victory, Vertue,</hi> or according to that of <hi>Juvenal:</hi>

                  </note>But afterward when as all Gods gifts were by Pagans made Gods and Goddesses, Money was also enshrined by the name of <hi>Dea Pecunia,</hi> in the figure of a woman holding a paire of ballance in one hand, and <hi>Cornucopia</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: unto whom I doubt not but as many commit Idolatry now, as then; when as the Greek proverb will be always verified, <hi>Chremata, Chremata Aner.</hi> Money, Money is the man, yea, and the fift Element.

               </p>
               <p>From the Latin word <hi>Moneta,</hi> came the old word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our English-Saxon Ancestours <hi>Munet,</hi> which we now call money, as the Germans <hi>Muntz,</hi> the French <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noies,</hi> the Italians <hi>Moneta,</hi> &amp; the Spaniard <hi>Moneda.</hi> Which as Civilians note, must consist of matter, forme, weight and value: for the matter, copper is thought to have been first coyned; afterward silver, for the cleannes, beauty, sweetnes, and brightness; and lastly gold as more cleane, more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, more sweet, more bright, more rare, more pliable and portable, aptest to receive forme, and divisible without losse, never wasted by fire, but more purified, not lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by occupying, rust or scurfe; abiding fretting, and liquors of salt and vinegar without damage; and may be drawne without wooll, as if it were wooll. So that these two metals have been chosen amongst all civill nations as by the common consent, to be the instruments of exchange and measure of all things. Albeit other matter hath been
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54112:95"/> used for money, as among the ancient Britains besides brasse, and iron rings, or as some say, iron plates reduced to certain weight; and among the Lacedemonians iron lingets quenched with vineger, that they may serve to no other use, and now the Indians have their <hi>Cacoas</hi> in some parts, and shells in other to serve for money. There also hath been stamped money of leather, as appeareth by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> who mentioned that there was in ancient time <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium forma publica percussum:</hi> and also that <hi>Frederick</hi> the second, when he besieged Millan, stamped leather for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And there is a tradition that in the confused state of the Barons warre, the like was used in England, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw any of them. But we have seen money made by the Hollanders of pastbord, <hi>Anno</hi> 1574.</p>
               <p>As for forme, because I hasten home, it were imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to note here, how the Jewes, albeit they detested images, yet they imprinted upon their sheckle on the one side the Gold pot which had the Manna, with this inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in Hebrew, <hi>Siclus Israelis. i.e. Sydus Israelis:</hi> and on the other side the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> with buddes and blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes, and <hi>Hierusalem Sancta.</hi> Or how the Dardanians stamped in their coynes two Cocks fighting; <hi>Alexander</hi> his horse <hi>Bucephalus:</hi> the Athenians an Ole, or an Oxe; from whence came the Proverbe against bribing Lawyers, <hi>Bos in lingua.</hi> They of <hi>Aegina</hi> a snayle, whereof also rose another Proverb, <hi>Virtutem &amp; Sapientiam vincunt testu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,</hi> For that money goeth beyond both valour and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>As for the Romans, as they did set down the image and inscription of the Consul while the Commonwealth flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, afterward of the Emperour on the one side, so they changed the reverse alwayes upon new events, or exploits, and it is supposed by some, that the great ounce Medalls both of brasse and gold were stamped for honour, and to continue the memory of Princes: neverthelesse they were currant as well as the smallest. And this manner of stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Princes image upon coynes was continued amongst
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54112:96"/> all civill nations; onely the Turks and other Mahumetans in detestation of Images inscribed the Princes name and yeare of the transmigration of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which happened in the yeare of our Lord, 622.</p>
               <p>After the arrivall of the Romans in this Isle, the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains imitated them; for they coyned both gold and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and yet there are extant some of <hi>Cunobelin</hi> King of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex and Middlesex with a beardlesse image inscribed <hi>Cuno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belin,</hi> and in the reverse, some with an Horse; some with a Coyner and <hi>Tascio;</hi> some with two heads conjoyned and <hi>Cuno,</hi> and in the reverse either an Hogge under a tree with <hi>Camu,</hi> or one eare of corne with <hi>Camu,</hi> to note as it seemeth, <hi>Camalodunum</hi> as they then called it, now <hi>Maldon,</hi> which was the principall seate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. There are likewise some to be seen of that famous <hi>Brunducia,</hi> which onely I heare of, but hitherto have not seen.</p>
               <p>When the Romans had extinguished the Kings here, they suppressed the British coynes, and brought in their own as a proofe of their conquest, which were currant here from the time of <hi>Claudius</hi> unto <hi>Valentinian</hi> the younger, the space of some 500. years. And whereas all the money for this part of the world was coyned a long time, either at Rome, Lyons, or Trier; <hi>Constantin</hi> as it seemed, erected a Mynt at <hi>London;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mint at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the Romans time.</note> for we have seen copper coyne of his with <hi>P. Lond. S.</hi> implying <hi>Pecunia Londini signata:</hi> and there was an officer as Treasurer of this Mynt at <hi>London</hi> called <hi>Praepositus Thesaurorum Augustensium.</hi> For <hi>London</hi> was called <hi>Augusta</hi> in the declining state of the Empire. Of these Roman coynes great plenty have been found, and daily are found, which were hid (as the Saxon Chronicle saith) when <hi>Maximus</hi> carried so many Britaines into <hi>France</hi> with him, and at divers other times overcovered in the ground in the sodaine ruinating of Townes by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons, and others.</p>
               <p>After the Romans had given over the possession of this Realme, it seemeth probable that their coyne was still
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54112:96"/> currant here a long time for there never as yet, as far as I understand, have been any coines found of <hi>Vortiger, Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Aurelius Ambrosius, Arthu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As for the Britaines, or Welsh, whatsoever <hi>Jura Majestatis</hi> their Princes had, I cannot understand that they ever had any coine of their own, for no learned of that nation have at any time seen any found in Wales, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The most ancient English coine which hitherto hath come to my sight, was of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of Kent, the first Christian King of our English Nation, and in that age and succeeding times, all Money-accounts passed by the names of <hi>Pence, Shillings, Pounds,</hi> and <hi>Manouses:</hi>

                  <hi>Pence</hi> seemeth to be borrowed from their Latin word <hi>Pecunia;</hi> or rather from <hi>Pendo,</hi> for the just weight thereof, which weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about three pennies of our money, and were rudely stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the Kings image on the one side, and the Mint-masters on the other, or else the name of the City where they were coyned.

               <p>Thirty of these pence, as <hi>Alfric</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> in his Saxon Grammer notes, made a <hi>Mancus,</hi>

This King coyned also half Nobles, called then the half penny of gold, lesse pieces of gold of 3. shillings 4. pence, and some of 20. pence, called the farthing of gold: and likewise in silver, Groates and half groates, by the advise of <hi>William Edingdon,</hi> Bishop of Winchester, and then Treasurer of England.</p>

So base and corrupted with copper were his money, as also of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, that some of them which was then called Testons, because the Kings head was thereon figured, contained but two pence farthing in silver; and other foure pence half penny. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of thrice happy memory, to her ever glorious renown, considering in the beginning of her raigne by the long sufferance of that base and copper moneyes, not only her Crown, Nobility, and Subjects of this her Realme to be daily more and more impoverished, the ancient and singular honour and estimation, which this Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had beyond all other by plenty of moneyes of Gold and Silver, only fine and not base, was hereby decayed, but also by reason of these said base moneyes, great quantity of forged &amp; counterfeits were daily made and brought from beyond Seas, for the which the ancient fine gold and silver, and the rich Merchandize of this Realme was transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and daily carried out of the same, to the impoverishing thereof, and enriching of others; And finally, hereby all manner of prices of things in this Realme▪ necessary for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation of the people, grew daily excessive, to the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and manifest hurt▪ and oppression of the state, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Pensioners, Souldiers, and all hired servants, and other meane people that live by any kinde of wages, and not by rents of lands, or trade of Merchandize. She, upon these considerations desirous to refine the coine, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the legall, but naturall estimation of the metall, first marked the base money, some with a Greyhound, other with a Portcullices, and other with a Lyon, Harp, Rose, or Floure de Lys, and after a time calling them to her Minte, repayed so much for them as they contained in pure silver; so that by her benefit England enjoyeth as fine, or rather finer sterling silver than ever it was in this Realme by the

But there is also the costly furring in their gowns, so much pounsing of chesell to make holes▪ so much dagging of sheres for he, with the superfluity in length of the foresaid gowns trayling in the dung, and in the mire, on horse and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so on foot, as well of man as of woman. That all that trayling is verily as in effect wasted, consumed, &amp; thred bare, &amp; rotten with dung rather then it it given to the poor. Upon that other
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54112:104"/> side to speak of the horrible disordinate scantness of cloathing, as been these cutted slops, or hanseliness, that through their shortness cover not the shamefull members of man, to wicked intent. Alas some of them shew the boss of their shape, and the horrible swoln members that seemeth like the malady of</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>in the wrapping of their hosen, and also the buttocks of him fare, as it were the hinder parts of a she ape in the full of the Moon. And moreover the wretched swoln members that they shew through disguising, in departing of their hosen in white and red, seemeth that half their privy members were slain. And if so be that they depart their hosen in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colours, as is white and blew, or white and black, or black and red, and so forsooth: Then seemeth as by variance of colour, that the half part of their privie members, been corrupt by the fire of</hi> S. Anthony, <hi>or by canker or by other such mischance: Of the hinder part of the buttocks it is full horrible for to see, for certes in that part of their body, there as they purge their stinking ordure, that foul part shew they to the people, proudly in despite of honesty, which honesty Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Chrift and his friends observed to shew in their life. Now as to the outragious array of women, God wot, that although the visages of some of them seem ful chast, and debonaire, yet notifie in her array and attire licourousness and pride. I say not that honesty in cloathing of man or woman is uncovena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but certes the superfluity of disordinate quantity of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is reproveable.</hi>

               <p>And not many years after, foolish pride so descended to the foot, that it was proclaimed that no man should have his shoes broader at the toes than 6. inches: &amp; women bummed themselves with foxe tails under their garments, as they do now with French farthin galles, and men with absurd short garments, insomuch as it was enacted, in 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. chap. 1. that no manner person under the estate af a Lord, shall wear from that time any gown or mantle,

               <p>Neither was the Clergy clear then from this pride, as you may perceive by <hi>Perce Plowmā.</hi> Albeit <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> and the late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (most reverend D. <hi>Parker</hi>) noteth that the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> never ware silk or velvet untill the time of the pompous Cardinall <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who opened that door to pride among them, which hitherto cannot be shut. The civill wars could not purge this generall vain humour, neither the laws still enacted in this behalf, neither if a contempt of gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and silk, could be brought into mens minds, which is an impossibility, but supposed by some to be the onely means to restrain the vain expences herein; neither do I think that the shamefull exceptions, which <hi>Zaleucus</hi> the <hi>Locrian</hi> provided in his laws, could stay our vanitie, who ordained that no woman should be attended with more than one maide in the street, but when she was drunk; that she fhould not goe out of the citie in the night, but when she went to commit adulterie; that she should not weare gold or embroidered apparel, but when she purposed to be a common strumpet. As for men that they should not wear rings or tissues, but when they went a whooring: yet for a close I wil tell you here how Sir <hi>Philip Calthrop</hi> purged <hi>John Drakes</hi> the shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker of <hi>Norwich</hi> in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. of the proud humour, which our people have to be of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens cut: This knight bought on a time as much fine French tawney Cloath as should make him a gown, and sent it to the Taylours to be made; <hi>John Drakes</hi> a shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that town, coming to the said Taylours, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Knights gown-cloath lying there, liking it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I will said he) have mine made as full of cuts as thy sheers can make it: it shall be done said the Taylor, whereupon because the time drew neer, he made haste of both their garments. <hi>John Drake</hi> when he had no time to goe to the Taylours till Christmas day, for serving of customers, when he had hoped to have worn his gown, perceiving the same to be full of cuts, began to swear with the Taylour, for the making of his gown after that sort. I have done nothing (quoth the Taylour) but that you bad me, for as Sir <hi>Philip Calthrops</hi> is, even so have I made yours. By my latchet quoth <hi>John Drake,</hi> I will never wear Gentlemans fashion again.</p>
               <p>How we have offended lately herein,<note place="margin">See page 17.</note> I referr to every particular mans own knowledge. I fear it will be verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which an old Gentleman said, when our posterity shall see our pictures, they shall think we were foolishly proud in apparell, as when they shall see our contracts, purchases, deeds, covenants and conveyances, they will thinke wee have been exceeding craftie, as we judge the contrary by the pictures and deeds of our Auncestors whom wee commend for plainness both in meaning and attyre, though in some ages, they offended in the latter as well as we.</p>

But those things do stay and shall stay, onely tossed a little to and fro. even as the billows of the sea. In one age there will be more adulterers, in another time there wil be excessive riot in banquetting; another while strange garmenting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy not without deformity of the mind. At another time, malapert boldness will square it out: In another age cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fury of civill war will flash out; and sometimes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowsing and drunkenness will be counted a bravery. So vices do ruffle among themselves, and usurpe one upon another. As for us we may say alwaies of our selves: We are evill, there have bin evill, and evill there will be. There will be alwaies Tyrants, Murderers, Theeves, Adulterers, Extortioners, Church-robbers, Traitours, and other of the the same rabblement.</p>

               <p>Notwithstanding some there are, which thinke that hereby hath been the saving of many lives, for that sieges, before the common use of them, continued longer to the greater loss of people, and more fields were fought, with slaughter of greater multitudes. At the siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there were slain and died ten hundred thousand. At the Surprises of <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi> then called <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> and <hi>Verulam</hi> neer St. <hi>Albans,</hi> were slain by <hi>Brundwica</hi> Princess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in the time of <hi>Nero</hi> 80000▪ At the siege of <hi>Alexia</hi> by <hi>Caesar</hi> 39. thousand, who also in his French and British wars, vaunted that there were slain eleven hundred ninetie two thousand men. But to omit ancient wars, at the battail of <hi>Hastings</hi> where <hi>England</hi> was conquered, were slain at the least 47944. English. At <hi>Cressi</hi> 30000. French. In that of Palme Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 360700. when as since the common use of gunns, at <hi>Flodden</hi> field were slain but 8000. At <hi>Mussleborough</hi> 4000. at the great battail of <hi>Dreux</hi> seaven or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and fewer in the latter battails. Unless you will with King <hi>Lewis</hi> the xi. of <hi>France</hi> suppose the number to bee corrupted in the antient histories, who could not be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beleeve, that there were so great armies levied, or so many slain as are specified in them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Armes,</hi> as ensigns of honour among military men in the general signification, have been as anciently used in this Realm as in any other; for as necessitie bred the use of them in managing of militarie affairs for order and distinction both of whole companies and particular persons amongst other nations, that their valour might thereby be more conspicuous to other; so likewise no doubt among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Iland, who alwayes have been as martiall as any other people whatsoever. In so much as unless we would conceive hardly of our own progenitors, we cannot think but that in martiall services, they had their conceits in their ensigns both for distinction, direction, and decency.</p>
               <p>He that would shew variety of reading in this argument, might note out of the sacred Scripture, that every Tribe of <hi>Israel</hi> pitched under their own Standard; out of prophane authors, that the <hi>Carians,</hi> who were the first mercenarie soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, first also bare marks in their shields: that the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> bare the Greek letter A. the <hi>Messonians</hi> M. &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:54112:111"/>
               <p>But to come home, some give the first honour of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Armories in this part of the world to the ancient <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> who going naked to the wars, adorned their bodies with figures and blazons of divers colours, which they conjecture to have been severall for particular families,<note place="margin">Notitia Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciarum.</note> as they fought divided by kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.</p>
               <p>When this Isle was under the command of the Romans, their troupes and bands had their severall signs, As the <hi>Britanniciam</hi> in their shield a Carbuncle, <hi>Britannici</hi> a Plat party <hi>per</hi> Saltier. <hi>Stablesiani</hi> a Plate within an annulet, <hi>Secundani</hi> an Annulet upon a cross.

               <p>In the Saxon Heptarchie I find little noted of Armes, albeit the Germans of whom they descended, used shields, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, <hi>colore fucata,</hi> which I know not whether I may call Armes or no, neither know I whether I may referre hither out of <hi>Beda,</hi> how <hi>Edwin</hi> King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> had alwaies one ensign carried before him called in English a <hi>Tuffe,</hi> which <hi>Vegetius</hi> reckoneth among military ensigns, or how King <hi>Oswald</hi> had a banneroll of gold and purple interwoven palie or bendie, set over his tomb at <hi>Bard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> Abbey in Lincolnshire; or how <hi>Cuthred</hi> King of <hi>West-sex</hi> bare in his banner a golden Dragon at the battail of <hi>Bureford,</hi> as <hi>Hovedon</hi> noteth, and the Danes in their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard a Raven, as <hi>Asserius</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of Armes in the generall signification, now somewhat of them in the restrict signification, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, or rather describe them, <hi>viz.</hi> That Armes are Ensigns of honour born in banners, shields, coats, for notice and distinction of Families one from the other, and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,

               <p>About this time the estimation of Aims began in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions to the Holy Land, and afterward by little and little became hereditary, when it was accounted most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to carry those Armes which had been displayed in the Holy land in that holy service against the professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christianity. To this time doth <hi>Petre Pithaeu</hi> and other learned French men referre the originall of heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Arms in <hi>France;</hi> and in my opinion without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to other, about that time we received the hereditary use of them, which was not fully established, untill the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third. For the last Earls of <hi>Chester,</hi> the two <hi>Quincyes</hi> Earls of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the two <hi>Lacyes</hi> Earls of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> varied still the Father from the son, as might be particularly proved.</p>
               <p>In these holy wars many arms were altered, and new assumed upon divers occasions, as the <hi>Veres</hi> Earls of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who bare before quarterly <hi>Gules</hi> and <hi>Or,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Genealogiae antiquae.</note> inserted a Mollet in the first quarter, for that a shooting star fell thereon, when one of them served in the Holy land. The L. <hi>Barkleys,</hi> who bare first <hi>Gules</hi> a Cheveron Arg. after one of them had taken upon him the Cross, (for that was then the phrase) to serve in those wars, inserted ten Crosses <hi>pattè</hi> in his shield. So <hi>Geffray</hi> of <hi>Boullion</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54112:113"/> General in those wars, at one draught of his bow, shooting against <hi>Davids</hi> Tower in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> broched three feetless birds called <hi>Allerions</hi> upon his arrow, and thereupon assumed in a shield <hi>Or</hi> three <hi>Allerions</hi> Argent on a Bend <hi>Gueles,</hi> which the house of <hi>Loraine,</hi> descending from his race, continueth to this day. So <hi>Leopold</hi> the fifth Marques of <hi>Austria,</hi> who bare formerly six Larks <hi>Or</hi> in <hi>Azure,</hi> when his coat-Armour at the siege of <hi>Acres</hi> in the Holy-land was all dyed in blood, save his belt, he took for his arms, <hi>Gueles,</hi> a white Belt, or a <hi>Fesse</hi> Argent, (which is the same) in memory thereof.</p>
               <p>About this time did many Gentlemen begin to bear arms by borrowing from their Lords arms of whom they held in Fee, or to whom they were most devoted.

               <p>In this and the succeeding ages, at every expedition such as were Gentlemen of bloud, would repaire to the Earle Marshall, and by his authority take coates of Armes, which were registred alwaies by officers of Armes in the Rolles of Armes, made at every service, whereof many yet remain: as that of the siege of <hi>Caer-laveroc,</hi> the battail of <hi>Sterling,</hi> the siege of <hi>Calice,</hi> and divers Tourniaments. At this time there was a distinction of Gentlemen of bloud, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of coate-armour, and the third from him that first had coate-armour, was to all purposes held a Gentleman of bloud.</p>
               <p>Well, whosoever would note the manners of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours in this nge, in wearing their coate armours over their harnesse, and bearing their Armes in their shields, in their Banners and Penons; and in what formall manner
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54112:118"/> they were made Bannerets and had licence to rear their Banner of Armes, which they presented rolled up to the Prince, who unfolded; and redelivered it with happy wishes; I doubt not, but that he will judge, that our ancestors were as valiant and gallant as they have been since they left off their Armes, and used the colours and curtaines of their Mistris beds in sted of them.</p>
               <p>Now what a large field would lie open to him that should seriously enter into this matter, he might say much, to omit Charges which seeme infinite, of the differences in Armes of them which descended of one House by the male; I doe not meane <hi>Labell</hi> for the first Sonne while the Father surviveth; the <hi>Crescent</hi> for the second, the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> unpierced, for the third; the <hi>Martlet</hi> for the fourth; an <hi>Annulet</hi> for the fifth; a <hi>Flour de lys</hi> for the sixt; and the rest, according as it pleased the <hi>King of Armes.</hi> These saving the first, were not in use in elder times; but began about the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second: and now, when Families are very far propagated are not sufficient for that use: For many should bear a <hi>Mullet</hi> within a <hi>Crescent,</hi> and an <hi>Annulet</hi> and <hi>Martlet</hi> thereupon very confusedly: But in past ages, they which were descended from one stemme, reserving the principall charge and commonly the colour of the Coate, took Borders, Bends, Quarters, Bendelets, Crossets, or some other addition or alteration. As for example. The first Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> bare Chequy <hi>Or</hi> and Azure, a Bendelet Geules, which the elder brethren kept as long as they continued; a second Son turned the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delet into a bend Geules, and thereon placed three Lioneux passant <hi>Or;</hi> from whom the <hi>Cliffords</hi> of Frampton descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Roger Clifford</hi> a second Son of <hi>Walter Clifford</hi> the first, for the Bendelet took a Fesse Geules; as the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> from him descended, beareth now; and the <hi>Cliffords</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> branched out of that House took the same with a border Geules. Likewise the eldest House of <hi>Stafford</hi> bare <hi>Or,</hi> a Cheveron Geules, but the younger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from them, tooke divers differences, as they of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54112:119"/> Pipe, did set about their Cheveron three Martlets sable, another placed three plates upon the Cheveron; they of <hi>Southwike</hi> added a border Sable, they of <hi>Grafton;</hi> a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ermin; they of <hi>Frome</hi> a border Geules; whereas also the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> did bear Geules on a Cheveron <hi>Or,</hi> three Lioneux rampant sable, the younger brethren of that house, <hi>viz. Cobham</hi> of <hi>Sterborrow,</hi> of <hi>Blackburg,</hi> of <hi>Biluncho</hi> took for the three Lioneux, three Estoiles, three Eaglets, and three Crescents: So of the descendants from the Lords <hi>Barkley,</hi> they of <hi>Stoke, Gifford</hi> and <hi>Ʋesey,</hi> added Ermines in the Cheveron; they of <hi>Beverston</hi> a border of Argent; they of <hi>Wimondham</hi> in the County of <hi>Leicester,</hi> changed their ten Crosses into as many Cinquefoiles.</p>
               <p>As for the difference of Bastards, none in old time bare the Fathers Armes, with a bend sinister, unless they were avowed and bare also their Fathers surname; but other coates were commonly devised for them; As Sir <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> bastard son of the Black Prince, bare <hi>Or</hi> on a bend sable three feathers Argent, which was borrowed from his fathers devise: <hi>John de Clarence</hi> base son to <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who valiantly recovered from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These Armes were for a long time borne single, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward two were quartered, then more marshalled together, to notifie from what houses the bearers were descended by heirs generall.</p>

But at the last he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to place <hi>France</hi> first, whether as more honourable, or of which he held great and rich territories, let others determine. All Kings hitherto sueceeding, have continued the same.

               <p>The first of the Nobilitie that quartered another Coate was <hi>Hastings</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who quartered his own coate with that of Valence of the house of <hi>Lusignian,</hi> in whose right he had that Earldome: And shortly after <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tild,</hi> sister and heir to <hi>Anthony</hi> Lord <hi>Lucy,</hi> gave a great part of her lands, to the heir male of the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> her second husband, conditionally,<note place="margin">

After these times every gentleman began to quarter the coate of the chief heir with whom his progenitour had matched, and often preferred that in the first place, if she were honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But after that divers were marshalled together for the honour of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> wife to King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth (who first of all our Kings since the Conquest mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his subject,) so many in imitation did the like, which so increased, that now of late some have packed fifty in one shield.

                  <p>His daughter <hi>Roper</hi> one day as she repaired unto him into the Tower, counselled him to recover the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54112:144"/> and his own former libertie, by doing I know not what, the which she said one of the greatest States of this Realme, and a man learned too, and his tender friend, said he might do, without scruple of conscience, as most of the Nobility of the Realme had done, not one sticking thereat, save onely himself, and one other man. This speech of her he answered with a pleasant tale. <hi>At a Bartholmew fair at</hi> London, <hi>there was an Escheator of the same City, that had arrested a Clothier that was outlawed, and had seized his goods, which he had brought into the fair, tolling him out of the fair by a train. The man that was arrested was a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern man, which by his friends made the Eschaetor to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested within the fair, upon an Action I wot not neer what; and called a Court of Pipowders. Now had the Clothier, by friendship of the Officers, found the means to have all the Quest almost made of the Northern men, such as had their Booths standing in the fair, who were no sooner departed from the bar, and come into the house, but the Northerne men were agreed, and in effect all the other to cast our Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Escheator. They thought they needed no more to prove that he did wrong, then even the name of his bare office alone. But then was there amongst them, as the Divell would, an honest man of another quarter called</hi> Company. <hi>And the fellow seemed but a silly soul, and sate still, and said nothing; they made no reckoning of him, but said, We be agreed now, come let us go and give up our verdict. Then when the poor fellow saw that they made such hast, and his minde nothing gave him that way that theirs did (if that their minds▪ gave them that way they said) he prayed them to tarry and talke upon the matter, and tell such reason therein, that he might think as they did, and when they should so do, he would be glad to say with them; or else he said they must pardon him: For sith he had a soul of his own to keep, as they had, he must say as he thought for his soul, as they must for theirs. When they heard this they were half angry with him. What good fellow, (quoth one of the Northern men) whare wannes thou? Be not we eleaven here, and thou but one all alone, and all we
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54112:144"/> agreed, whereto shouldst thou stick? Whats thy name gud fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Masters (quoth he) my name is called</hi> Company.

Would God good masters (quoth the man again) that there lay no more weight thereon. But now, when we shall hence, and come before God, and that he shall send you unto Heaven for doing according unto your conscience, and me to the divell, for doing against mine, all passing at your request here for good company now. By God Master</hi> Dickenson <hi>(that was one of the Northern mens names,) If I then shall say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all again; Masters, I went once with you for good company, which is the cause that I go now to hell, play you the good fellows now again with me, as I went then for good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with you, so some of you go now for good company with me: would you go Master</hi> Dickenson? <hi>Nay, nay, by our Lady, nor never a one of you all. And therefore must you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for passing as you pass; for the passage of my poor soul passeth all good company.</hi>

                  <p>He used friendly to admonish a certain Bishop, not to forsake his sheep, but rather leaving <hi>Rome</hi> to repair home and execute his Office. This Bishop upon a time came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and told him that he was minded to go out of the Citie, for one month, and to visite his sheep, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did desire that he might depart with his good leave and liking: <hi>Poole</hi> answered, <hi>I shall take this comfort by your departure, that you shall be beaten the less.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Letters were shewed unto him very artificially penned, which one had sent unto a great man, to comfort him for the death of his friends, and to that intent had used all the places of Rhetorick, he read them, and then said; <hi>That he never in all his life had ever read Letters, that could bring greater comfort; for they were such, that no man that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54112:148"/> should reade them, could be able to keep himself from laughing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having heard a certain Preacher of great name, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated much to himself, and did passingly please himself; he was asked what he thought of the man. <hi>Poole</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>Well, but I would that he would first preach unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and then afterward to others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a Nobleman of <hi>Rome</hi> told him, that he did trust that he should come to his pleasant gardens, which he had sumptuously made, yea thirty years after, and wondred at the beauty of them: <hi>Pool</hi> answered, <hi>I hope I have not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so ill of you, that you should wish me so long a banishment from my heavenly country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While he was in the Low Countries, and one day would have gone unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, but he could not be admitted to his speech: but two dayes after the Bishop of <hi>Arras</hi> was sent unto him by the Emperour, to excuse his long stay and desire him to come unto him: <hi>Pool</hi> said, that he had strange hap, <hi>That whereas he spake daily unto God for the Emperour, yet he was not admitted unto the Emperour to talk with him about a matter belonging to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There vvas one that vvas very curious in keeping of his beard, and it was reported that he bestovved every month two duckats upon the trimming of it. <hi>If it be so</hi> (said <hi>Pool) his beard will shortly be more worth than his head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Paulus Tertius</hi> vvhen many Cardinals came unto him, and told him, that if he liked of it, they vvould make him Pope: <hi>He desired them to look well to it, that they were swayed by no passion of the minde, or did ought for favour, and good will, but refer all their cogitations whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the honour of God, and the profit of his Church; the which onely they all ought especially to have alwaies before their eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When one of the Cardinals of the adverse faction did one day charge him with ambition, and said that he did untimely and over-hastily seek the Popedome: He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red gravely, <hi>That he thought not the burthen of that great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be so light, but that hew as of the mind, that it was rather to be feared, than desired. As for them which understood not,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54112:148"/> and thought more basely of so great a place, be lamented their case, and was sorry for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Cardinall <hi>Farness,</hi> and divers others of his friends came unto him, at midnight, to make him Pope, by adoration, he repelled them saying; <hi>He would not have so weighty a matter tumultuously and rashly done, but usually and orderly; that the night was no convenient time therefore, that God loved the light more than darkness, wherefore they should defer it untill the next day, and that then, if it pleased God, it might very well be done.</hi> But this his pious modesty lost him the Papacy.</p>
                  <p>He used often to say, <hi>Those which would betake them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the study of the holy Scriptures, (which was as though they would go into the inner and secret part of the Temple) must pass through a low and narrow door: For that no man can attain to the understanding of the Scriptures, that is proud and puffed up with the sharpness of his wit, or excellency of humane learning; but he that bringeth lowliness of minde, and contempt of himself, and yeelds his understanding</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>captive unto faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this also did he often admonish those that would stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the sacred Scriptures, <hi>That they should specially beware that they never went to the reading of them with this intent and minde, that they might dispute of them to shew their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by that knowledge to get them honours and riches; for both purposes were very contrary to this kinde of study. Whereunto ought to be adhibited, first fervent prayers, then a lowly minde, and finally an heart void of all ambition and greedy desire.</hi> Thus far of this good Cardinall.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the dignity of Poetry much hath been said by the worthy Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> &amp; by the Gentleman vvhich proved that Poets vvere the first <hi>Polititians,</hi> the first <hi>Philosophers,</hi> the first <hi>Historiographers.</hi> I vvill onely adde out of <hi>Philo,</hi> that they vvere Gods ovvn creatures; vvho in his Book <hi>de Plantatione Noe,</hi> reporteth, that when he had made the whole Worlds Mass; he created Poets to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate and set out the Creator himself, and all the Creatures: you Poets reade the place and you will like it. Howsoever it pleaseth the <hi>Italian</hi> to censure us, yet neither doth the Sun so far retire his chariot from our Climate, neither are there less favourable aspects betweene <hi>Mercury, Jupiter,</hi> and the Moone, in our inclination of Heaven, if Poets are <hi>Fato,</hi> as it pleased <hi>Socrates,</hi> neither are our Poets destitute of Arte prescribed by reason, and grounded upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but they are as pregnant both in witty conceits and devices, and also in imitation, as any of them. Yea, and according to the Argument excell in grandity and gravity, in smoothness and propriety, in quickness and briefness. So that for skill, variety, efficacie and sweetness, the four materiall points required in a Poet, they can both teach and delight perfectly.</p>
                  <p>This would easily appear if any lines were extant of that worthy <hi>British</hi> Lady <hi>Claudia Rufina,</hi> so commended by <hi>Martial;</hi> or of <hi>Gildas</hi> which <hi>Lilius Giraldus</hi> saw in the libraries of <hi>Italie,</hi> or of old <hi>Chedmon</hi> who by divine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration about the yeare 680. became so divine a Poet in our
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54112:160"/> English tongue, that with his sweet verses full of compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he withdrew many from vice to vertue, and a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feare of God: or of our <hi>Claudius Clemens</hi> one of the first founders of the University of <hi>Paris:</hi> and doth most clearely appear to all that can judge by many learned Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems published in this our learned age. But whereas these latter are in every mans hand, and the former are irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, I will only give you a taste of some of middle age, which was so overcast with darke clouds, or rather thick fogges of ignorance, that every little sparke of liberall lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning seemed wonderfull: so that if sometime you happen of an uncouth word, let the time entreate pardon for it, when as all words have their times, and as he saith:
<q>

                  <p>We will begin with <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Excester,</hi> who followed our K. <hi>Richard</hi> the first, in his warres, in the holy land, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated his acts in a book called <hi>Antiocheidos,</hi> &amp; turn'd <hi>Dares Phrigius</hi> so happily into verse, that it hath been Printed not long since in <hi>Germ.</hi> under the name of <hi>Cornelius Nepos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The passing of the pleasant river <hi>Simois</hi> by <hi>Troy,</hi> and the encounter between the waves of the sea, and it, at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emboging, or inlet thereof, he lively setteth forth thus:

This his device had no life, because it had no Motte: but his answer gave it life, when he said to one demanding his meaning, That they were his sons which did so peck him, and that <hi>John</hi> the yongest, whom he loved best, practised his death more busily than the rest. <hi>[Giraldus Cambrensis distinct.]</hi>

                  <p>The victorious <hi>Black Prince,</hi> his son, used sometimes one Feather, sometime three, in token, as some say, of his speedy execution in all his services, as the Posts in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man times were <hi>Pterophori,</hi> and wore feathers to signifie their flying post-haste.

Whereupon he asked on a time his sons when he saw them, beholding this device set up in a window, what was Latin for a fetter lock: whereat when the young gentlemen studied, the father said, well, if you cannot tell me, I will tell you, <hi>Hic, haec, hoc, taceatis,</hi> as advising them to be silent and quiet, and therewithall said, <hi>Yet God knoweth what may come to pass hereafter.</hi> This his great Grandchild, King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth reported, when he commanded that his younger son <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> should use this device with the fetter-lock opened, as <hi>Roger Wall</hi> an Herald of that time reporteth.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, whose untrained youth and yeelding lenitie hastned his fall used commonly a white Hart couchant with a crown, and chain about his neck. For wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the which, some after his deposition, lost their lives.

                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth (as it is in Master <hi>Garters</hi> book) used a Fox tail dependent, following <hi>Lysanders</hi> advice, if the Lyons skin were too short, to piece it out with a Foxes case.</p>
                  <p>His half brethren surnamed <hi>Beaufort</hi> of Beaufort in <hi>France</hi> (which came to the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> by <hi>Blanch</hi> of Artois, wife to <hi>Edmund,</hi> first Earl of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) and who after were Dukes of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> &amp;c. bare a Portcullis gold; whereunto not long afterward was added this word <hi>AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERA SECURITAS.</hi> And not long since by the Earls of <hi>Worcester</hi> issued from them, <hi>MUTARE AUT TI MERE SPERNO.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>A lavish tongue might seem to have damnified the Gentleman, vvhich took for his device a Landskip, as they call it, and solitary Mountains, with <hi>TUTI MONTES, TUTUM SILENTIUM.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had no great care to express his conceit in an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese, vvhich nevertheless he did express, which bare a white shield inscribed, <hi>NEC CURA NEC CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACTER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Knight of <hi>Venus</hi> was he, who as triumphing over her force, bare her Son (winged <hi>Cupid</hi>) in a net, with <hi>QUI CAPIT CAPITƲR.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Star called <hi>Spica Virginis,</hi> one of the fifteen which are accompted to be of the first magnitude among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers, with a scrole inwritten, <hi>MIHI VITA SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CA VIRGINIS,</hi> declared thereby haply, thad he had that Star in the ascendent at his Nativity, or rather, that he lived by the gracious favour of a virgin Prince.</p>
                  <p>One in our sea-faring age adventuring himself and all he had to the Seas, proposing no certain arrivall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, made a Ship with full sail in the Sea, and superscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>PONTUS IN IGNOTO.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His minde mounted above the meane, vvhich devised
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54112:179"/> for himself, one that had clambred much more than half the way of a steep Mountain, adding this word neer him, <hi>DIXERUNT FATUI,</hi> omitting the other part of the verse, <hi>Medium tenuere beati.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise he hoped to attain the height of his desire, which made one climing to the middle of a <hi>Piramis,</hi> with <hi>HVCSPE,</hi> by him, and <hi>ILLIC SPES</hi> above him.</p>
                  <p>Another also which climed in his conceit, but as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fearing a fall, made a man upon the upper degrees of a Ladder, with this Mot adjoyned, <hi>NON QUO SED UNDE CADO.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He referred Fate, Fortune and all to his Soveraigne, which drevv for himself the twelve houses of Heaven, in the forme which <hi>Astrologians</hi> use, setting down neither Sign, nor Planet therein, but onely placing over it this word, <hi>DISPONE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like reference had he which onely used a vvhite Shield, and therein written, <hi>FATUM INSCRIBAT ELIZA.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be doubtfull vvhether he affected his Soveraign, or Justice more zealously, which made a man hovering in the ayr, with <hi>FEROR AD ASTREAM,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may easily conjecture what he conceived, vvho in his shield reared an Oare with a sail fastened thereunto, adding, <hi>FORSET VIRTUS MISCENTUR IN UNUM.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Full of loving affection was he to his Lady, which bare a Rose upon his pricking branch, with <hi>ABIGITQUE TRAHITQUE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With many a blustering blast he seemed to have been tossed, vvhich painted an Horizon, vvith all the Cardinall and collaterall winds blowing, and in the middest <hi>RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIUNT QUE FERUNTQUE.</hi>

                  <p>As to the honour of <hi>Magellanus</hi> (vvhose ship first passed round about the world, though he miscarried) was devised the terrestriall Globe, with <hi>TU PRIMUS CIRCUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEDISTI ME.</hi> So our Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54112:180"/> effected the same, had devised for him a Globe terrestriall, upon the height whereof is a ship under sayl, trayned about the Globe with two golden halsers, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of an hand out of a cloud, and a dragon volant upon the hatches, regarding the direction with these words, <hi>AUXILO DIVINO.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Imprese too perplexed &amp; unfitting for so worthy a man, who as one said to him most excellently in this Dissich. <hi>PLUS ULTRA, Hercule is inscribas, Drake, columnis,</hi>

                  <p>A man verily worthy to be eternized by some good pen, as also his servant <hi>John Oxenham,</hi> who arriving with 70. men in the straight of <hi>Dariena</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> drew a land his ship, and hiding it with boughs, marched over the land vvith his company, guided by <hi>Negros,</hi> untill he came to a River vvhere he cut vvood, made him a Pinnass, entred the South Sea, went to the Island of <hi>Pearls,</hi> lay there ten days, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in tvvo Spanish ships 60. thousand weight of gold, and one hundred thousand in Bars of silver, returned safely to the main land: but through the mutinie of his souldiers he miscarried, and as the Poet saith <hi>Magnis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit ausis,</hi> in an adventure never attempted by any, and therefore not to be forgotten, when as the <hi>Lopez</hi> a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard hath recorded it not vvithout admiration, as you may see in the Discoveries of the learned and industrious <hi>M.

                  </p>
                  <p>It seemed a difficultie unto him to live rightly either in liberty or bondage, which painted one Greyhound, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, with, <hi>IN LIBERTATE LABOR,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tied to a tree gazing on the game, with, <hi>INSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VITUTE DOLOR.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot imagine what he meant, which took for his devise a small brook passing along the lands mildly, till it came to a damme, and there rising and raging overflowed the lands, with, <hi>MAGIS MAGISQUE,</hi> written in the place overflowed: unless he would give us to understand
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54112:180"/> that the more his affections were stopped, the more they were stirred.</p>
                  <p>He which took a man armed at all points, with, <hi>ME ET MEUM,</hi> while he shewed a resolution in his own behalf, forgat God; and that of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>DIEU ET MONDROIT,</hi> God and my right.</p>
                  <p>In the Impreses of <hi>Ruscelli</hi> I finde that sir <hi>Richard Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> Knight of S. <hi>Johns,</hi> used a white Faulcon with this Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Motto, <hi>FEYFID ALGULA, Id est,</hi> Faith and gentleness, which Falcon he quartered in his Arms by the name of <hi>Michelgrove,</hi> as they say.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Laurell sacred to learning is never hurt by lightning, and therefore the Cock resorteth thereunto in tempests, as natural Historians testifie: He seemed studious of good learning, and fearfull of danger, which caused to be painted for him a Cock under a Laurell, with <hi>SIC EVITABILE FULMEN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An amorous affection was onely noted in him vvhich set down an eye in an heare, with <hi>VULNUS ALO.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He also held one course, and levelled at one marke, which made a River in a long tract disgorging himself into the Sea, with <hi>SEMPER AD MARE.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>He proposed to himself honour in Martiall service, which made a Trophee, or trunk of a tree with harness and abillements of War, and a Sepulchr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>He elegantly shewed by whom he was drawn, which depainted the Nauticall compass, with, <hi>AUT MAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES, AVT MAGNA.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ascribing his life and all to his Lady, pictured a tree neer a spring, and at the root thereof, <hi>QVOD VIVAM, TUUM.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He shewed himself to be a Martiall, and a Mercuriall man, which bare a sword in one hand, and a Bay in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with <hi>ARTI ET MARTI.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>A Gentleman Scholler drawn from the Universitie where he was well liked, to the Court, for which in respect of his bashfull modesty, he was not fit; painted a red corall branch, which while it grevv in the Sea vvas green, vvith this, <hi>NUNC RUBEO, ANTE ƲIRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAM.</hi>

                  <p>About that time, when some dislikes grew between the English and the States of the united Provinces, they fearing that it might tend to the hurt of both, caused to be imprinted two pitchers floating on the water upon a Medalia, with <hi>SI COLLIDIMVR, FRANGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVR.</hi>
